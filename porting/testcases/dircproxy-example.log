[15 Jan 19:16] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Yeah, the deal worked out pretty good.
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I mean, they're not handing me big bags o' cash, but it will be enough that we can make things work fine
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I'm a little bummed that I'm probably going to have to price my house to sell
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I am REALLY upset at how much realtors end up costing when your house has gone up in value :-D
[15 Jan 19:17] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, i think you're right on that one
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the rich get richer...
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They gave me 9 months to get there
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +oh wow
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I can remote until then
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But I feel like if I don't get to the office soon it will put me at a disadvantage
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +maybe summer will see things turn around..
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, can't wait that long I think.
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Ic
[15 Jan 19:19] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you're going to be a good czar :)
[15 Jan 19:19] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They're being really superflexible, I think that I'm the one who is making it into a "must-do-now" thing
[15 Jan 19:19] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> hang on, brb
[15 Jan 19:19] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +10-4, i dont blame you for getting on with it
[15 Jan 19:22] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Just putting something on the tube for the kids until bedtime
[15 Jan 19:23] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so is the rest of the fam as excited as you?
[15 Jan 19:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: I think so
[15 Jan 19:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> At first we thought we'd be going to Raleigh, but it became really clear that the best way to do this job was in Westford
[15 Jan 19:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> A lot of it involves communication with the Engineering folks up there, lots of RHEL managers
[15 Jan 19:24] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so MA is where all the real work gets done?
[15 Jan 19:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So doing that f2f is probably a lot better... plus there's a big Fedora staff there, lots of the folks I know... Jesse Keating, Jeremy Katz, Tom Callaway, Luke Macken, etc.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Yeah, at least the coding work
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> There are a few engineers in Raleigh, but about 95% of those guys are in MA.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Bill Nottingham, for example, is in NC.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So I start orientation on the 4th, but I'm staying a whole week to make meetings with Legal, Marketing/BrandComm, GLS, etc.
[15 Jan 19:26] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +im guessing you're planning on leaving the fam here for a bit?
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Well, just for when I do my orientation
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I might have to do a trip to BOS for maybe a week too
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But really, no
[15 Jan 19:27] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well give a shout if you need anything
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Since I can remote for <= 9months, we can all move together
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Originally I was thinking we needed to sell and buy at the same time, which would have been... well, hard.
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ahh i got the impression that you wanted to be there 4 weeks a month
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +starting in feb
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, I do want to be there ASAP, but not without them :-)
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:)
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I'm increasingly thinking (thanks to wiser friends) that we should rent for a few months up in NH and then buy a place
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Probably easier even if it means moving twice
[15 Jan 19:29] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I think i'd agree too
[15 Jan 19:29] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I can't believe I'm going to work in the same company as Alan (#*%&ing Cox!
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:D
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Oh yeah, and Dave Jones... Greg DeKoenigsberg...
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you da man
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:D
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> not me
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I just hang around with people who are da man
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +HAH
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +*whatever*
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But I can be a good figurehead apparently
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Lots of hot air and not much substance, y'know
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +indeed i do
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> FUDCon was awesome
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> We should definitely get you involved so you could meet some of the hackers
[15 Jan 19:31] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +everything go fine with the airport shuffle and jsmith?
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Just fine
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> His plane was delayed until almost 1am, but it was no big deal
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Easy drive
[15 Jan 19:31] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +wow, I thought the whole city of Richmond closed at 9
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, this was picking him up at RDU
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, I'd like to swing FUDCon sometimes
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I dropped him off at RIC on Sunday night, no problem there either
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I was hoping to get a RH certification one of these years..
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ahh
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well good
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: So you do Linux development stuff at work, right?
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +VERY little
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Hm
[15 Jan 19:33] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, there will be another FUDCon style hackfest and Fedora sessions at the Red Hat Summit in Boston in June
[15 Jan 19:33] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that sounds like it could be a very good time
[15 Jan 19:33] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You should try and make that GETA training. It's actually a pretty cheap treat
[15 Jan 19:33] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ill mark it on the calendar :)
[15 Jan 19:34] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> ISTR it's like $995 for registration and entry to everything
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that is cheap
[15 Jan 19:34] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So with travel, RIC -> BOS you should be able to bring it in for well under $2K
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +most def
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +our unit is (or at least has been) really good about training too
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You can see as much RHEL stuff as you want, meet the F Project guys at the hackfest, come out with us for the parties at night (to the extent you like that sort of thing)
[15 Jan 19:35] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +im sold.
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Cool, I'm holding you to it :-)
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And maybe jsmith-away too if he can swing it
[15 Jan 19:36] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sounds like community relations to me :)
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Exactly
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> jsmith-away is so excited -- I think he really had a great time there
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I got him hooked up with Mike McGrath, our Infrastructure community honcho
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They may be working up some Asterisk stuff for us, and hopefully a couple other cool projects
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +an open souce company using an open source pbx?
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:p
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, at least for Fedora, I mean
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I told him he needs to work that other angle too ;-)
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i think its a great idea
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> All right, I'm gonna run to another desktop to do some work, but feel free to shout at me if you need something
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sure, you too
[15 Jan 19:38] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and like i said, let us know if you need anything
[15 Jan 19:38] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +as we're local :)
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I will, you guys are the greatest
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd:  Do you want some lamps by any chance?
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> In perfectly good shape, just we don't want them anymore (and anything we don't want and have to move, we just have to find a place for later)
[15 Jan 19:40] * stickster runs afk for a bit for kids' story time and bedtime
[15 Jan 20:38] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> jsmith-away: Help!
[15 Jan 20:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Who ate with us on Friday night?  You, me, Clint, Toshio, Michael DeHaan, Chris Negus, and... ?

[20 Jan 23:53] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i hear good things about the latest fedora releases tho
[20 Jan 23:53] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i still have bad dreams about RPM however :)
[20 Jan 23:53] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: fedora needs an option like in debian to have your hdd's encrypted
[20 Jan 23:53] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +from start

[20 Jan 23:54] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so i wanna make some apps and get them include, so give me some tasks
[20 Jan 23:54] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I never had bad dreams about RPM
[20 Jan 23:54] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +cause im tired of sitting up at night rebuilding my lan
[20 Jan 23:55] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i started using RH around 7 i believe
[20 Jan 23:55] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> nombyte: You should get involved with the websites team or the infrastructure team
[20 Jan 23:55] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i'm sure its much better these days :)
[20 Jan 23:55] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +why do u suggest those 2?
[20 Jan 23:56] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Because websites involves Python programming with Turbogears, which is supposed to kick serious ass, and the infrastructure team always needs more good admins
[20 Jan 23:56] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ok, so how do i start?
[20 Jan 23:56] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> If PL hired you, I'm betting you could hang with those guys
[20 Jan 23:56] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:D thanks
[20 Jan 23:56] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +what is PL?

[21 Jan 00:05] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +eclipse is a bit large for me
[21 Jan 00:05] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i like the power over ssh

[21 Jan 00:05] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +when i ssh i usually just use vi
[21 Jan 00:05] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, same
[21 Jan 00:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmm
[21 Jan 00:06] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmm?
[21 Jan 00:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +does gobby use version control of some kind
[21 Jan 00:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +or is it independent
[21 Jan 00:06] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmm, not sure
[21 Jan 00:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +it looks neat
[21 Jan 00:06] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i believe you'd have to use something independent
[21 Jan 00:06] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +liks svn
[21 Jan 00:07] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea

[21 Jan 00:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the best thing i think about my job
[21 Jan 00:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +is we get access to an online university
[21 Jan 00:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +which has a online repo of books
[21 Jan 00:07] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, we do too, but it isn't very good
[21 Jan 00:08] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so i can just go online and search python and bam!
[21 Jan 00:08] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +oh who do u use?
[21 Jan 00:08] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +haha, thats awesome

[21 Jan 00:09] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +not quite the same as yours i believe

[21 Jan 00:16] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +we use skillsoft for books

[21 Jan 00:17] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +cool
[21 Jan 00:17] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i use the UMW library, which actually has a pretty good selection

[21 Jan 00:18] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +seems like a good selection
[21 Jan 00:21] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea
[21 Jan 00:21] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i have an interest in LISP, but its scary :)
[21 Jan 00:23] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i wish u could download online books
[21 Jan 00:24] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +haha, why?
[21 Jan 00:25] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +for travel, you could read offline
[21 Jan 00:25] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah
[21 Jan 00:25] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea
[21 Jan 00:25] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i dont really travel much :)
[21 Jan 00:25] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +since i'm in school and all
[21 Jan 00:25] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah
[21 Jan 00:25] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and paper books are good for that too
[21 Jan 00:26] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya but I'd want a lot and they'd be heavy
[21 Jan 00:26] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +this is true
[21 Jan 00:26] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i usually carry 2, just in case i get bored with the first
[21 Jan 00:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:d id need like 1000 :D
[21 Jan 00:27] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +my schedule this semester has a lot of 1.5 hour breaks, so i have a decent amount of downtime to read a chapter or something
[21 Jan 00:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +or write a program
[21 Jan 00:28] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +indeed
[21 Jan 00:28] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i think some of the coolest things in python are pickles
[21 Jan 00:29] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +pickles?
[21 Jan 00:29] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya, u can take anything in python and pickle it
[21 Jan 00:29] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +like lets say u create an airplaine object
[21 Jan 00:29] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +u can pickle that object and python writes it out to a file in ascii
[21 Jan 00:29] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +then u can import it when u need it
[21 Jan 00:30] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i pickle tuples and lists all the time
[21 Jan 00:30] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah, neat
[21 Jan 00:30] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +kinda like JSON?
[21 Jan 00:30] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +never used it
[21 Jan 00:30] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +does the same thing, but in javascript
[21 Jan 00:31] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah, thats why they use it in turbogears and ajax
[21 Jan 00:31] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +kinda like serialization
[21 Jan 00:31] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea
[21 Jan 00:31] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +gotcha
[21 Jan 00:31] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +same thing basically
[21 Jan 00:31] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +just meant for over a wire instead of a file
[21 Jan 00:31] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i suppose u could pickle an object and send it over the wire :D
[21 Jan 00:32] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that is neat though

[21 Jan 22:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Hi nombyte
[21 Jan 22:09] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: are u busy?
[21 Jan 22:09] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Usually, but go ahead :-D
[21 Jan 22:09] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster? busy?  Never!
[21 Jan 22:09] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I never let that get in the way of a good question

[21 Jan 22:09] * jsmith ducks and hides behind stickster's tremendous to-do list
[21 Jan 22:09] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Or a stupid answer from me ;-D
[21 Jan 22:11] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i was just gonna ask if you'd maybe help me get the dmcrypt and luks program you helped me with before working in fedora 8
[21 Jan 22:11] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +since i've redone the gui and made a bunch of other changes
[21 Jan 22:12] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Sure, post the tarball or script somewhere and I can see what happens when I run it here
[21 Jan 22:12] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ok, just some info
[21 Jan 22:12] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +tho
[21 Jan 22:13] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the part you helped me on was launching the program from python and forcing input to it
[21 Jan 22:13] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +which i wish i understood but i don't yet
[21 Jan 22:13] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +in fedora 7 cryptsetup asked for a password and new we were done by looking for a '\n'
[21 Jan 22:13] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the continued
[21 Jan 22:13] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +*then
[21 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Oh, was that the whole popen thing?
[21 Jan 22:14] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +in fedora 8 the new version of cryptsetup gives u a warning right after the password and looks for 'yes' or 'no' but no '\n'
[21 Jan 22:14] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +at the end
[21 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I can't recall at this point, it was a long time ago
[21 Jan 22:14] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya, which i just dont' get
[21 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> nombyte: You should check out the Python Tutor list.
[21 Jan 22:15] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I read it and they answer questions like this all the time -- a few of the regulars are real-life book authors and very good at explaining
[21 Jan 22:15] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Better than a mug like me
[21 Jan 22:15] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I kind of figure it out on the fly and usually don't understand it well until later
[21 Jan 22:15] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:D im reading through the python books on ciber's online university
[21 Jan 22:15] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +which they have a turbogears book too! :D
[21 Jan 22:15] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so im gonna hit that up
[21 Jan 22:16] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ok so give me a sec to look for the program
[21 Jan 22:20] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: ok where should i put the tar?
[21 Jan 22:21] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You could use the FredLUG files page
[21 Jan 22:21] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +or i could just email it to you?
[21 Jan 22:21] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i don't want anyone to grab it till its atleast functional
[21 Jan 22:22] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> open source == release early + release often
[21 Jan 22:22] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> even when it doesn't work.
[21 Jan 22:22] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya but open source w/ bugs could = problems which could = people pissed at me. :D
[21 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> All the hundreds of people pulling software from the FredLUG files page?
[21 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> :-)
[21 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Besides, once I've got it you can just delete it
[21 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Of course, you could have emailed it by now
[21 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> :-D
[21 Jan 22:23] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +lol
[21 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Open source also means if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
[21 Jan 22:24] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya...
[21 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Don't worry about whether anyone's going to be made at you -- you didn't sell them a warranty!
[21 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> s/made/made/
[21 Jan 22:24] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +fine...
[21 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> ARGGGGHHH
[21 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> s/made/mad/
[21 Jan 22:24] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i also hate the fact that people could snatch it and claim it as their own
[21 Jan 22:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> When it's done and working they're far more likely to do that, don't you think? :-)
[21 Jan 22:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You need to read some of the books on the philosophy of open source.
[21 Jan 22:25] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya but then it goes to, well if no one is gonna know i made it, whats the point.
[21 Jan 22:25] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yup
[21 Jan 22:26] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +um, home, meetings, members
[21 Jan 22:26] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +where is the file page?
[21 Jan 22:26] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hey there forsaken
[21 Jan 22:26] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Off on the right somewhere

[21 Jan 22:27] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +how goes this evening
[21 Jan 22:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i have nothing off to the right
[21 Jan 22:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and the word 'file' isn't on the page which i assume it would be
[21 Jan 22:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +not bad
[21 Jan 22:27] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +u?

[21 Jan 22:36] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +forsaken being a student i wanted to explain my ncs program which i kinda have abandoned and see what u thought about it

[21 Jan 22:36] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i dont really know what ncs is

[21 Jan 22:37] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +was a program i was working on mainly to be used by people doing research
[21 Jan 22:37] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +how it would work would be u run ncs
[21 Jan 22:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So what's not working?
[21 Jan 22:38] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: the creation of the ecrypted container where it popen is
[21 Jan 22:38] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I think it just worked for me.
[21 Jan 22:38] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I created a ~100KB container and it looks fine
[21 Jan 22:38] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +it makes the file but if u try to finish the process it says it isn't a valid file or something like that

[21 Jan 22:41] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so is it a CMS?

[21 Jan 22:41] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and it downloads it to ur comp and builds a library

[21 Jan 22:42] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +then i made a gui which shows ur whole library and allows u to organize it and launch the content and such
[21 Jan 22:43] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +interesting
[21 Jan 22:43] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +p2p?
[21 Jan 22:43] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i assume
[21 Jan 22:43] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +no
[21 Jan 22:43] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +its my own repo program
[21 Jan 22:43] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +downloads off my web server
[21 Jan 22:43] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so to prove the concept my friend said he needed to write a paper on viruses
[21 Jan 22:44] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so i made a nice archive of research i found and verifed on every aspect of the subject
[21 Jan 22:44] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +gave him ncs
[21 Jan 22:44] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +he ran the program selected viruses and downloaded it all
[21 Jan 22:44] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +then he used the library offline and used it to write his paper
[21 Jan 22:44] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +cause i also had the sources listed and everything
[21 Jan 22:45] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sounds useful, but pretty intensive on your side
[21 Jan 22:45] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but i guess all the info everyone adds gets added
[21 Jan 22:46] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +how is it different than the online DB's, except i assume that it's free?
[21 Jan 22:46] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya the plan was to make it community supported and allow people to add articles the found or movies they found to the archive through a web interface which i made pretty easily
[21 Jan 22:47] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +idk i didn't do any reasearch on programs out there like it
[21 Jan 22:47] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i just made it for practice
[21 Jan 22:47] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, sounds useful, if not slightly illegal :)
[21 Jan 22:48] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +as long as there isn't any copywrited material in it, it wouldn't be illegal

[21 Jan 22:49] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya i abandoned it cause i thought it was pretty useless actually
[21 Jan 22:49] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +heh yea, it would be useful, but requires a lot of upkeep
[21 Jan 22:49] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +plus i asked people on diff. forums what they thought and no one thought it was a good idea
[21 Jan 22:50] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +thats the thing tho, if people submit content they find, it would grow really quick

[21 Jan 22:50] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +people is the hard part :)
[21 Jan 22:51] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +for me, i can come up with  idea, build the site and programs, but then i don't know where to go from there

[21 Jan 22:51] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +one of those things where u need people for it to be useful
[21 Jan 22:51] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so nobody uses it :)
[21 Jan 22:52] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +because it isnt useful yet
[21 Jan 22:52] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ya
[21 Jan 22:52] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i really wanna make one cool program which makes people take a step back and go, "wow"

[21 Jan 23:02] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but its just a gui, not sure if that counts
[21 Jan 23:04] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +what is it
[21 Jan 23:04] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +do u know what dmcrypt and lucksetup is?
[21 Jan 23:04] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +or dmcrypt-luks
[21 Jan 23:05] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +not particularly
[21 Jan 23:05] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +it allows u to encrypt devices or to  create an encrypted file container of any size u can store sensitive files in
[21 Jan 23:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah, neat
[21 Jan 23:06] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but it uses keys so u can create keys for any number of users and remoke keys

[21 Jan 23:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sounds like good stuff
[21 Jan 23:06] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you make a GUI for it?
[21 Jan 23:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i made a gui for the container part so far
[21 Jan 23:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +as well as
[21 Jan 23:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +using a list tree to keep track of all ur containers with a save/open function
[21 Jan 23:07] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and i am going to add the ability to manage keys from the gui
[21 Jan 23:08] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i also have the code for the device encryption but i haven't added it yet
[21 Jan 23:08] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +nice
[21 Jan 23:08] <forsaken!n=eric@c-71-62-234-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i have never really encrypted much
[21 Jan 23:08] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i hoping so

[21 Jan 23:08] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +its great in my eyes

[25 Jan 12:48] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -whats that?
[25 Jan 12:50] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -so its a shell with a modern language used for its scripting?
[25 Jan 12:50] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +No, it's a graphical power-user's shell
[25 Jan 12:51] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -um...
[25 Jan 12:53] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -a little confusing
[25 Jan 12:53] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -i just read their page
[25 Jan 12:55] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -i mean its really cool
[25 Jan 12:55] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -but what does it have to do with the program i wanna make?
[25 Jan 12:57] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I guess I equated your "ssh manager" with the hotwire shell
[25 Jan 12:58] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -for mine im thinking more like, u add all ur connections in and their settings and they get saved
[25 Jan 12:58] <nombyte!n=nomb@c-71-62-193-105.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -then u just use the app and select the one u want and, BAM (emeril), ur connected
[25 Jan 12:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +OK...

[25 Jan 21:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +pretty please!
[25 Jan 21:16] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +So the idea was that you would register, and enter your location.  I happened to be in Salt Lake City at the time.
[25 Jan 21:16] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +You'd also set your preferences such as "willing to respond to email" or "willing to present in person" or "willing to help install Linux"
[25 Jan 21:17] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Then when people came along that needed help, their please for help would get answered by a live neighbor
[25 Jan 21:17] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Somebody that could drive over to their house, say "Here, push this button", etc.
[25 Jan 21:17] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +So, here's the story
[25 Jan 21:17] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +(I'll be short)
[25 Jan 21:18] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +A guy contacted me through the Army of Friends thing
[25 Jan 21:18] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Said he was going to school to be a CS major, and wanted to figure out what this whole "free compiler" thing in Linux was all about
[25 Jan 21:18] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +You know, good compilers don't just grow on trees...
[25 Jan 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +So I loaned him my Red Hat (7.3?) CDs, and walked him through getting things installed
[25 Jan 21:19] * stickster remembers getting GCC back in 'round 86/87 or so
[25 Jan 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Over the next couple of months, I answered a few emails from him, but he seemed to catch on quickly
[25 Jan 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Now fast-forward four or five years
[25 Jan 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'm chatting with this guy in IRC, and he starts to tell me this story, about how he first got started w/ Linux
[25 Jan 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +AND IT'S THE GUY I HELPED!
[25 Jan 21:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hehe
[25 Jan 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Turns out he's a major contributor to Gnome now...
[25 Jan 21:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +small world
[25 Jan 21:21] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +That may be the *only* success story from the whole Army of Friends effort, as short-lived as it was.
[25 Jan 21:21] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +But it taught me something....

[25 Jan 21:22] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> For some time there was a f-mentors project, but it withered on the vine too.
[25 Jan 21:23] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> There were the usual participation problems, but even more so with trying to staff some sort of "help line" 24/7 (or even 9/5)
[25 Jan 21:24] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Well, this wasn't anything like that.  It was just a directory of people in your local area who are willing to help (whether it be via email, or in person, or over the phone)
[25 Jan 21:25] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Yeah, see, I dig that personal touch a little more.
[25 Jan 21:25] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I put myself on the list for OSN, but I think maybe I saw this one too; did it have a big fist-looking hand on the page logo?
[25 Jan 21:25] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: In a perfect world, you could call the "Fedora Help Line" and they'd say "We have an agent in your neighborhood.  Prepare to be invaded."
[25 Jan 21:26] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> jsmith: We're not too incredibly far away from that, actually
[25 Jan 21:26] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Or at least, being *able* to do that if people want to

[27 Jan 21:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I left at 2pm

[27 Jan 21:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I would have done it manually ;)

[27 Jan 21:48] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Yup, full remove functionality too
[27 Jan 21:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hey - I was thinking today; the gnome key-ring functionality has me puzzled ......
[27 Jan 21:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +how come it's not connected to my authentication on login?
[27 Jan 21:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Why do we need the double authentication?
[27 Jan 21:49] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> There are some in favor of changing that
[27 Jan 21:49] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> If you google for David Zeuthen, for example, on fedora-desktop-list, he's brought this up a few times in the past.
[27 Jan 21:50] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +what's the reason to keep them separate?
[27 Jan 21:50] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I'm trying to understand the logic behind the current design
[27 Jan 21:50] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I would think the problem is letting possibly untrusted apps have access to your account passphrase.
[27 Jan 21:51] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ahhh - well, you're still prompted for that. My issue is that I have to "unlock" the key everytime I signon when I'm wireless.
[27 Jan 21:52] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> plarsen: That's normal.
[27 Jan 21:52] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> But...
[27 Jan 21:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I've already authorized NetworkManager to get access to the key ... that's not the issue.
[27 Jan 21:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I just don't get the logic behind having the keyring manage a separate "password" from my session ?
[27 Jan 21:53] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> OK, so let's figure this out logically
[27 Jan 21:53] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> (Noting that neither of us has consulted the docs on how and why it's done this way) ;-)
[27 Jan 21:53] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +lol
[27 Jan 21:53] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well, I didn't see anything about "why" just how it worked. But no, I didn't read the whole thing
[27 Jan 21:54] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> So part of it is to "sandbox" the access of applications to sensitive information
[27 Jan 21:55] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I get that, and I certainly get the need to keep the information encrypted/protected.
[27 Jan 21:55] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> If your account passphrase unlocks the keyring at the same time you get authenticated...
[27 Jan 21:55] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But my pam-authorization should have been enough to open it?
[27 Jan 21:56] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> You mean like http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/Pam ?
[27 Jan 21:56] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Well, I saw that was out there (and I didn't manage to get it working).
[27 Jan 21:56] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +My problem is understanding the need for double "login" if you will
[27 Jan 21:58] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I feel like some of the people I teach when I get the look that says: Why are you making things so complicated ..... :D
[27 Jan 21:59] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> plarsen: I feel like if you want to know WHY these decisions are the way they are, you need to ask someone who developed the thing.
[27 Jan 22:00] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +uhmmm true ;)
[27 Jan 22:00] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I can guarantee you they thought about this, though
[27 Jan 22:00] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> It doesn't mean their answer was best, just what they felt was right to do at the time
[27 Jan 22:00] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +if that's the only source I might just go and do that (hate being a bugger to those who invest time/energy into making this stuff - don't need to spend time on non-important things like this)
[27 Jan 22:01] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> It may be a FAQ item to which they can direct you -- I'm sure this isn't the first time someone's wanted to know this ;-)
[27 Jan 22:01] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Heck, I do too
[27 Jan 22:01] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> The PAM thing is designed basically as a kludge -- it synchronizes the 'login' keyring passphrase with the account passphrase
[27 Jan 22:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yeah . and I want to use it (as I said, it didn't work when I tried it a few weeks back).
[27 Jan 22:02] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Frankly, I think it makes a lot of sense to separate the two
[27 Jan 22:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But the page you have is a bit different, so I'll try that.
[27 Jan 22:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ohhh?
[27 Jan 22:02] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I use a *MUCH* stronger gnome-keyring passphrase than I do on my actual account
[27 Jan 22:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I'll love to hear the logic you see
[27 Jan 22:02] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Because that keyring holds passphrases to a hundred different assets I use.
[27 Jan 22:03] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> If someone gets access to my actual Linux account, they don't get much they can't already find on public web sites.
[27 Jan 22:03] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> But my keyring has SSH passphrases to other machines, and quite a number of other things
[27 Jan 22:04] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +That's simply the "many door locks" argument. We can always create lots of doors to make us feel safer. It seems to me that if we secured the first door better we could make life behind the door easier?
[27 Jan 22:04] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> What about a stolen laptop? I'd say it makes a *big* difference in that situation.
[27 Jan 22:04] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmmmm my keyring is pretty small. It holds my private keys; all my ssh is done with my public key.
[27 Jan 22:04] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> And since my lappy is my main workhorse....
[27 Jan 22:05] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: encryption of hdd ... which is one of my next larger projects
[27 Jan 22:05] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Actually, that's already coming for F9 ;-)
[27 Jan 22:05] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> It's in Rawhide, you can try it today.
[27 Jan 22:05] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I've seen it even in F7 ... but "by hand" if you understand. I'll give rawhide a peek :D
[27 Jan 22:06] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> F9 has the option as a single simple checkbox in Anaconda
[27 Jan 22:06] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hehe
[27 Jan 22:06] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +cool
[27 Jan 22:07] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I think there might be another good reason here:
[27 Jan 22:07] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> A keyring store that you rsync across machines with different account passphrases.
[27 Jan 22:08] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> This is not a really far-out proposition -- I know a lot of people who rsync /home or centrally store it and use via NFS, CIFS, et al.
[27 Jan 22:08] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> And again, a more secure passphrase is one that's different from your others; hence the PAM solution is ugly there.
[27 Jan 22:11] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +my point is, that youi're already authenticated through gdm or login. It seems to me like the argument is, that you cannot trust that authentication?
[27 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Well, the authentication is only part of it -- you still need to provide the encryption algorithm with key data.
[27 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> s/encryption/decryption/
[27 Jan 22:14] <infobot!i=ibot@pdpc/supporter/active/TimRiker/bot/apt> +stickster meant: plarsen: Well, the authentication is only part of it -- you still need to provide the decryption algorithm with key data.
[27 Jan 22:14] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> In the PAM case above, the passphrase you provide the 'login' process is used to provide the key data.
[27 Jan 22:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that's the design decision that I'm trying to wrestle ;)  you might as well use the same password as you logged in with?
[27 Jan 22:15] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> So if that's not the same from one computer to another, but you sync the keyring... you see the problem ;-)
[27 Jan 22:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I've never sync'ed keyrings - so maybe that's my issue
[27 Jan 22:16] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> But you have to admit that the network-mounted /home is not an unheard-of use case...
[27 Jan 22:16] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Sometimes this is in cahoots with a directory, sometimes not
[27 Jan 22:17] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> In the future?  With Amazon EC2/S3, or some other online data storage?  I'd guess it will be more important.
[27 Jan 22:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: true, in NIS type environments that's what you do. But the keyfiles should only be rw for the owner - nobody else?
[27 Jan 22:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well, that's an interesting issue - but if you want to use "public" storage why not simply use an encrypted filesystem?
[27 Jan 22:19] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> The keyring significantly predates a lot of the usable encrypted filesystem layers.
[27 Jan 22:19] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> So far, I haven't seen anyone successfully code for the computing environment 2 years in the future
[27 Jan 22:19] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> :-)
[27 Jan 22:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ehhhh ... how old is gnome keyrings? I didn't see it until about 1 year back. Encrypted file-systems have been around for at least 5-6 years in the linux stack?
[27 Jan 22:21] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Maybe not easily used, but through loopback it's been fairly simply to encrypt everything but the root filesystem
[27 Jan 22:22] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +anyway - apprechiate the input
[27 Jan 22:22] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I see your point
[27 Jan 22:23] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Yeah, it was around at least as early as 2004
[27 Jan 22:24] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> And one has been able to encrypt a file system for a long time, but the user-accessible pieces are only now starting to actually be usable.
[27 Jan 22:24] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +right
[27 Jan 22:25] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> Since usability is the name of the game, making a Joe User go do a bunch of arcane commands where failure == total data loss is kind of a non-starter :-)
[27 Jan 22:25] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the user-gui's are always lacking behind .... feature wise we're able to do a lot, but it's not for beginners ;)
[27 Jan 22:25] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +right
[27 Jan 22:25] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I agree
[27 Jan 22:25] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +And I see Fedora, ubuntu and Suse as distros that are trying and working on fixing that
[27 Jan 22:26] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I was really interested in that DSL installation we did this weekend.
[27 Jan 22:26] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that looked REALLY cool. I agree
[27 Jan 22:26] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> I had never tried it before.
[27 Jan 22:27] <stickster!n=npaul@fedora/stickster> And with Google apps, there's no reason you can't have a very usable system on a shoestring budget.
[27 Jan 22:28] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I touched in several years back .. but just touched.
[27 Jan 22:29] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I wasn't even aware they had an X on top of it

[04 Feb 14:14] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -    problem is that the files end up with the wrong file context which confined

[04 Feb 14:20] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but if i had to guess, id say for sure it was selinux causing your problem
[04 Feb 14:20] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -well simple way to tell

[13 Feb 11:05] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +its so frustrating cause im so close...

[13 Feb 11:06] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> So if I mistype the password or whatever, I still get the " Command failed: No key available with this passphrase." error.
[13 Feb 11:06] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i believe so yes
[13 Feb 11:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> So whatever is going on appears to be with your pexpect stuff.

[13 Feb 11:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Your question is good.  You should read some of the other questions they get.
[13 Feb 11:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Don't worry about looking dumb; ego gets in the way of learning.

[13 Feb 17:17] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Then you'd be working with someone who (1) knows how to help you learn, and (2) you don't have to start from scratch to do something useful.

[20 Feb 17:57] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Are you talking about interference, or non-working-ness?

[20 Feb 17:58] * jsmith has no clue
[20 Feb 17:58] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +i substitued an nvidia card for my ATI card and couldn't activate my wireless card
[20 Feb 17:59] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +installed a new nvidia driver and was able to activate it one time, could not replicate the activation
[20 Feb 18:00] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +took the nvidia card back to office depot

[20 Feb 18:00] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Sounds like an interrupt conflict or other hardware<->OS issue.
[20 Feb 18:01] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Forget the signal thing
[20 Feb 18:01] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I thought you were talking about interference :-)
[20 Feb 18:01] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +good point, how would i change the IRQ's
[20 Feb 18:01] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> IrishW0lf: You might want to try checking your BIOS?
[20 Feb 18:02] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +i guess i will next time, i think you are right though on the iterupt conflict
[20 Feb 18:03] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +i have an agp slot for my video, all other slots are pci

[20 Feb 18:05] <IrishW0lf!n=william@70-41-125-18.cust.wildblue.net> +i did chedk dmesg and saw some irq problems

[12 Mar 15:53] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -hey guys I'm looking at creating a local yum repo  and I was wondering if this directory structure seems correct.
[12 Mar 15:53] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -centos/5/base/i386/
[12 Mar 15:53] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -centos/5/updates/i386/
[12 Mar 15:54] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +smbmabling: there shouldn't be any point in separating updates and base.
[12 Mar 15:57] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -what if I put a structure like centos/5/updates/i386/server1
[12 Mar 15:58] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -centos/5/updates/i386/server2
[12 Mar 15:58] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -and put specific application based RPMS in the server directories and then had .repo files that were called on each server for its particular directory ...does that make sense or am I thinking in a circle
[12 Mar 15:59] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Why would you seperate by server?
[12 Mar 15:59] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +The whole idea is to have ONE central repository - not one per server?
[12 Mar 15:59] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -I guess you really don't.
[12 Mar 16:00] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -my thought was that if you get specific rpms that have requirements that might interfere with installation of RPMS that another server uses
[12 Mar 16:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +That would then be a separate repository; if there are conflicts, I don't really see how keeping them together/seperate solves the conflict?
[12 Mar 16:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Just because a rpm is in repository doesn't mean you have to use it
[12 Mar 16:02] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -this is true
[12 Mar 16:02] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +So with one big repository, you can have 10 machines with different packages.
[12 Mar 16:03] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -point well taken
[12 Mar 16:03] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -it sounded funny in my head so I wanted to spit ball it off someone else
[12 Mar 16:04] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> As long as there aren't ENVR conflicts, that should work OK.
[12 Mar 16:04] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> If you've got two different versions of 'foobar' you want to run on two different servers, you'd better darn well have them in separate repositories
[12 Mar 16:05] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: right ... that's what I thought above; like Livna - if there are conflicts. But I don't see that you need to repositry "conflicts" per server.
[12 Mar 16:05] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +That makes little sense (to me)
[12 Mar 16:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Nor to e
[12 Mar 16:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> *me
[12 Mar 16:06] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Although there are interesting easy ways to do these kind of tricks with yum if you use a repo definition like http://myserver/yum/repo/$yum1/
[12 Mar 16:06] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> There are user-set envars you can make use of to actually do some cool stuff with yum, if you need to be able to separate out repos in a weird way.
[12 Mar 16:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Sorry, that should be $YUM1, all caps
[12 Mar 16:31] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -does anyone has experience with FDS ?
[12 Mar 16:34] <smbmabling!n=sbamblin@pointe.mkisystems.com> -or more detailed the smbldap tools for FDS

[18 Mar 17:13] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -stickster: when you are using eclipse and create a new packge, what is the __init__.py for?  Is that just where you are suppose to start the whole package at?
[18 Mar 17:15] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> nmcbride_: Google "Python __init__.py"
[18 Mar 17:15] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -The ‘__init__.py’ files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as ‘string’, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, ‘__init__.py’ can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
[18 Mar 17:16] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -so then what ever the name of the directory is, is what you would use for the module :D

[31 Mar 09:55] * nombyte_work lets out a yawn...
[31 Mar 09:55] <nombyte_work!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -morning
[31 Mar 10:25] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: How busy are you today?
[31 Mar 10:25] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +
[31 Mar 10:25] * jsmith hopes that's not a rhetorical questions, but figures it very well might be
[31 Mar 10:25] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Well, I'm never bored...
[31 Mar 10:25] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: But what's up?
[31 Mar 10:25] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Wondering if you had a F9Beta DVD image by chance
[31 Mar 10:25] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> I have x86_64
[31 Mar 10:25] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +Hmmmn... that should work
[31 Mar 10:26] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Plus I have Live for i686 and x86_64
[31 Mar 10:26] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +
[31 Mar 10:26] * jsmith wonders if he can install that on top of i386 Xen
[31 Mar 10:26] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Rrr
[31 Mar 10:26] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Not sure
[31 Mar 10:26] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +Might as well try, right?
[31 Mar 10:26] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> But the Live i686 would allow you an install, then you could jimmy a different package set onto it
[31 Mar 10:26] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +Worse comes to worse, I'll install it on another hard drive
[31 Mar 10:27] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +WORKSFORME
[31 Mar 10:27] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +Would it be too much trouble to get you to make me a copy of both of those (i686 live, x86_64 full), and I"ll stop by and pick them up
[31 Mar 10:40] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Can do
[31 Mar 10:40] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Want to come by today?
[31 Mar 10:41] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Oh crud.
[31 Mar 10:41] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Can you bring some media for the x86_64 DVD? I have no recordables.
[31 Mar 10:41] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> I have plenty of CD-R though, the other's no problem.
[31 Mar 10:41] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Sorry.
[31 Mar 11:01] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: What time were you thinking?
[31 Mar 11:01] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Whatever is most convenient for you... I've gotta meet my wife in downtown Fred at noon.
[31 Mar 11:01] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I could stop by before or after
[31 Mar 11:02] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Or any other random time
[31 Mar 11:02] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> After sounds fine -- you have my address?
[31 Mar 11:02] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> easy as pie to get here
[31 Mar 11:03] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I have it somewhere... why don't you /msg me with it
[31 Mar 11:05] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Looks like I'll have the newer Live i686 snapshot from this weekend
[31 Mar 11:06] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Even better ;-)

[31 Mar 11:31] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Hang on
[31 Mar 11:31] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> I'm going to deregister, come back in a sec
[31 Mar 11:33] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Hang up and try agan
[31 Mar 11:34] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +Calling
[31 Mar 11:34] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: OK, I'm registered again and back on

[31 Mar 11:35] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> hang on
[31 Mar 11:36] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> I'm calling you

[31 Mar 11:37] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> OK
[31 Mar 11:38] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> jsmith: If I had time to download a DVD image, would you prefer i686 or x86_64?
[31 Mar 11:39] <jsmith!n=user@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Doesn't matter

[31 Mar 13:00] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +Anyone know of open source / standards monitoring suites that besides monitoring hosts and network devices can easily be extended to monitor other types of devicdes systems, via for instance webservices?
[31 Mar 13:02] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> plarsen: You might want to try #fedora-admin or #fedora-websites where we have a lot of folks interested in those things
[31 Mar 21:36] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +uhmmm - that didn't help much stickster :(  Still on the hunt for info about governments or localities that are switching to open source OS isntead of MS
[31 Mar 21:41] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> plarsen: A little persistence sometimes goes a long way. ;-)
[31 Mar 21:44] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Was it something like http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/ ?
[31 Mar 21:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +no - I know that ... what I'm looking for is a framework that's much more than snmp
[31 Mar 21:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +basically something that'll easily be customized to read any device that'll "talk" to the world. That be via telnet, x25, soap, rpc etc.
[31 Mar 21:46] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Or rather - where you as a developer add a "plugin" or whatever you want to call it, to interact with a common framework
[31 Mar 21:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I've seen several that seems to deal great with snmp and other basic types of access; but when it comes down to a framework that'll work for "any" type device I seem to hit a wall - that I can't seem to pass (getting the info requires a lot of time).
[31 Mar 21:52] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Hmm, search me.
[31 Mar 21:53] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> But I would try again at #fedora-admin -- leaving one message at 13:27 isn't going to catch a lot of people who are in and out
[31 Mar 21:53] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Look for someone like mdomsch, mmcgrath (not back 'til tomorrow I think), or abadger1999
[31 Mar 21:54] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> mdomsch is the chief Linux architect at Dell

[04 Apr 11:43] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -the second issue is i made a udev rule to make /dev/net/tun chmod 0666 and for some reason after updating it isn't applying the udev rule

[04 Apr 17:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Keeping in mind that you'll need older hardware so as not to confuse the older Linux.
[04 Apr 17:44] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> So the interface is IDE?
[04 Apr 17:44] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -correct
[04 Apr 17:44] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> It's not a parallel over IDE is it?
[04 Apr 17:45] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -i don't think so
[04 Apr 17:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> There's info in /usr/share/doc/kernel-*/Documentation/ide.txt about engaging ide-tape 
[04 Apr 17:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I'm not sure how up to date it is, but it's definitely at the 2.6 level.
[04 Apr 17:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You need the 'kernel-doc' package installed
[04 Apr 17:47] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -i need someone to ssh in and take a look :D :P

[04 Apr 17:48] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -so basically i have to reboot and add "hdx=scsi" to my kernel line?
[04 Apr 17:48] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You can try
[04 Apr 17:49] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I have no idea if that still works.
[04 Apr 17:49] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -is the 'x' a placeholder
[04 Apr 17:49] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -or do i actually use x
[04 Apr 17:49] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> yes for a letter for the drive position.
[04 Apr 17:49] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> a = primary master, b = primary slave, c = sec master, etc.
[04 Apr 17:49] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -i wonder if its bad that there is no mention of the drive in dmesg... :D
[04 Apr 17:50] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> That's why I think that's iffy -- because now there's a new libata library that makes all those SCSI devices.
[04 Apr 17:50] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -wait yes there is

[04 Apr 17:52] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Yeah, I'd look at it as suspect until proven innocent.
[04 Apr 17:52] <nmcbride_!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> -thats what im trying to do i just don't know enough
[04 Apr 17:52] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Normally, Sense Key: Illegal Request errors like that mean the drive responded with something that doesn't make any sense to the controller.
[04 Apr 17:52] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You see it a lot on drives going bad.

[07 Apr 13:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Hi plarsen -- actually the only people there were Mark Walker and me
[07 Apr 13:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> We figured out how to use gst-launch at the command line to burn a DV .avi file to Ogg Theora
[07 Apr 13:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +wow - small an intimate :)
[07 Apr 13:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> And a couple other how-to type things.
[07 Apr 13:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +cool - wish I could have been there!
[07 Apr 13:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I was at the Stafford Co. schools IT expo this weekend, met Jay Cooke from the IT support group
[07 Apr 13:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> They are putting Linux servers in around the county -- I got him interested in the LUG and coming out to some meetings
[07 Apr 13:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +Ohh?? Sounds interesting - did you get anything interesting out of that meeting?
[07 Apr 13:48] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> At the very least joining the list to ask questions, and again volunteering our help.
[07 Apr 13:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +:D
[07 Apr 13:48] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I also showed off the OLPC XO to a bunch of attendees and talked about Linux to some folks.
[07 Apr 13:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +that's really becomming a hit all over

[08 Apr 10:20] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +stickster: so doing some looking, my wifi disconnects when wpa scans supposedly.  This was a bug in FC7 for the 32bit version and I guess its still in the 64bit version.  When I was running the 32bit F8 I didn't have this problem. :D
[08 Apr 10:21] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> nombyte: What kind of wireless?
[08 Apr 10:21] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> What network utility? nm-applet? knetworkmanager?
[08 Apr 10:22] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Have you filed a bug?
[08 Apr 10:22] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +wep, NetworkManager
[08 Apr 10:22] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and wpa_supplicant
[08 Apr 10:22] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +not yet it was 3am when i found all this out
[08 Apr 10:23] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and when i stop NM and wpa_supplicant, and setup the wifi manually... wpa_supplicant still starts up
[08 Apr 10:23] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +cause i had it working that way for like 5 mintues.
[08 Apr 10:23] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +then wpa came up, and bam, lost connection
[08 Apr 10:25] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I don't understand why wpa_supplicant is coming up. That's for WPA and WPA2 only AIUI
[08 Apr 10:25] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i read that the new NetworkManager doesn't handle any encryption anymore
[08 Apr 10:25] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +that wep is handled by wpa as well
[08 Apr 10:26] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +they talked about that in a "future release" but it was an old post so I assumed that was the case
[08 Apr 10:26] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You know what they say about "assume" ;-)
[08 Apr 10:26] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Have you tried backing up and removing your .gconf/system/networking/ store and restarting NetworkManager and nm-applet?
[08 Apr 10:26] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +ya, but given the evidence it fits
[08 Apr 10:26] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +nope
[08 Apr 10:26] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i can tho
[08 Apr 10:27] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You probably want to logout and do that from a text terminal to avoid confusing gconfd-2
[08 Apr 10:27] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +ill have to do that at home :D im on a wired connection here :D
[08 Apr 10:28] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +im using twisted to make my own backup suite :D
[08 Apr 10:40] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +stickster: can i ask u a python question which i just haven't been able to grasp?
[08 Apr 10:40] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Sure, if I can't answer it I'll tell you]
[08 Apr 10:40] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +u can this is easy
[08 Apr 10:41] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +u can refrence this: http://paste.turbogears.org/paste/2459
[08 Apr 10:41] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +so i have the Echo class
[08 Apr 10:41] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and made a def __init__
[08 Apr 10:41] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +which has (port=33333)
[08 Apr 10:42] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +so u can either send in a port, or use 33333 as the default
[08 Apr 10:42] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i tried making everything self.port
[08 Apr 10:42] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +but nothing allows me to get the reactor.listenTCP(port, factory) to see the variable
[08 Apr 10:42] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I don't understand line 17.
[08 Apr 10:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Shouldn't that be:
[08 Apr 10:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> factory.protocol = Echo()
[08 Apr 10:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Or maybe what you mean is:
[08 Apr 10:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster>    if type(options.port) != types.NoneType:
[08 Apr 10:43] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +this was my original code
[08 Apr 10:43] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +http://paste.turbogears.org/paste/2460
[08 Apr 10:43] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and it worked
[08 Apr 10:43] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +with just Echo
[08 Apr 10:43] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster>       factory.protocol = Echo(int(options.port))
[08 Apr 10:44] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster>    else:
[08 Apr 10:44] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster>       factory.protocol = Echo()
[08 Apr 10:44] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +most likely
[08 Apr 10:44] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +but that still wont solve my port error
[08 Apr 10:45] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +made that change
[08 Apr 10:45] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and i still get NameError: name 'port' is not defined
[08 Apr 10:45] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I think you have a scope misunderstanding.
[08 Apr 10:46] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i have a misunderstanding somewhere :D
[08 Apr 10:46] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +and its really slowing me down :D, cause i will get it working but not understand it
[08 Apr 10:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> In the Echo class, the "port" variable is only understood in the scope of __init__
[08 Apr 10:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> To hold on to it in the class instance, you need to make sure you have:
[08 Apr 10:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster>    self.port = port
[08 Apr 10:46] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Then you can reference self.port in other functions in the class.
[08 Apr 10:47] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +i tried that
[08 Apr 10:47] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@208.176.91.226.ptr.us.xo.net> +let me try again
[08 Apr 10:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> But your other commands are potentially a problem because they are not scoped in a function of the class.
[08 Apr 10:47] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> They should either be in __init__ or some other function that you call from your main code.

[02 May 15:08] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> nombyte: Hmm
[02 May 15:09] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> nombyte: I think used loop devices show up in /proc/partitions
[02 May 15:09] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> And I'd bet there's a sysfs way to do it.
[02 May 15:10] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> Does 'losetup -a' show you in-use loop devices? That might be something else to use.
[02 May 15:15] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +hmm, that could work.

[02 May 15:27] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> People there actually know the answers to these things
[02 May 15:46] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +i tried the python channel but I just got people saying they don't make guis...
[02 May 16:16] <stickster!n=npfrield@fedora/stickster> nombyte: In #fedora-python?
[02 May 16:16] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +no in python

[09 May 15:42] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: nope - that shows what are being shared
[09 May 15:42] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: not what's being used ;)
[09 May 15:42] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> I think without the -e it shows clients
[09 May 15:43] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> The man page agrees with me, apparently
[09 May 15:44] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> but no NFS server running here so I can't check
[09 May 15:44] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Can you cluster that shelter with Linux?  :-P

[09 May 15:45] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Yeah, it doesn't generally *get rid of entries* well
[09 May 15:46] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> plarsen: I want to say there was something in /var/lib/nfs, like xtab or something, that was more reliable... sometimes
[09 May 15:46] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> Maybe /var/state/nfs, I've forgotten :-\
[09 May 15:47] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-24-125-211-129.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Well, issue is it claims the mountpoint is in use - and the only two hosts listed have both umounted

[13 May 12:51] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: When you get a free moment, mind trying out f-spot in F9?  It's hanging on me... just looking for a sanity check before I open a bug.
[13 May 12:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: At what point?
[13 May 12:56] * stickster leaves it open for now and points at...

[13 May 12:56] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Either trying to import photos, or just plain launching it (sometimes, not always)
[13 May 12:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Bug 441103 it is... grabbing the debug info now
[13 May 12:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Mmmn... 23 megs of debugging symbols, while all the mirrors are being pounded on...
[13 May 16:41] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: When you get a free second, mind helping me?  I seem to be having a serious brain-blockage today, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong
[13 May 16:42] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: It would be regarding virtualization and KVM
[13 May 16:49] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: Sorry, been on phone for the last hour
[13 May 16:49] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> hit me!
[13 May 16:53] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: OK... for the life of me I can't get virt-manager to let me create a new KVM vm
[13 May 16:53] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> What do you get in the way of errors?
[13 May 16:54] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Nothing... I just can't choose any hypervisor except for qemu
[13 May 16:54] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'm sure there's something stupid I'm missing... I have the kvm package installed, libvirtd is running...
[13 May 16:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: Aha
[13 May 16:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Is the 'kvm_intel' module loaded?
[13 May 16:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> And was the qemu service started?
[13 May 16:55] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +qemu started... let me look for kvm_intel
[13 May 16:56] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +both kvm and kvm_intel kernel modules are loaded
[13 May 16:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> hrm.
[13 May 16:56] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +But still no dice
[13 May 16:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> And you're running 64-bit F9?
[13 May 16:57] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +32-bit
[13 May 16:58] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> aha
[13 May 16:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Although I may reinstall on 64-bit once I get the 64-bit DVD
[13 May 16:58] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I think you have to be running 64-bit F9 for the longword support you need for full KVM virt.
[13 May 16:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Oh?
[13 May 16:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Why wasn't that documented anywhere ;-)
[13 May 16:58] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> hrm.
[13 May 16:58] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I swear this worked on this same machine in 32 bit mode before I re-installed though
[13 May 16:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Let me try a reboot... just to be  safe...
[13 May 16:59] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Do you have the binary /usr/bin/qemu-kvm ?
[13 May 16:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yes.
[13 May 16:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I think I do
[13 May 16:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yes, I do.
[13 May 16:59] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I wonder if running that manually might be the thing to do to figure out the problem. Sometimes libvirt can hide things too much when there's tshooting to be done.
[13 May 17:00] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Gonna reboot and see if that helps... I've installed a lot of stuff on this poor puppy since the last reboot
[13 May 17:00] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> urg.
[13 May 17:00] * stickster makes unhelpful guttural noises.
[13 May 17:01] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I know, I know.
[13 May 17:04] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Never seen this one before... "Not using downloaded repomd.xml because it is older than what we have"
[13 May 17:04] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Nothing like flushing the yum cache to make things work again

[13 May 17:25] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I'm back in town, but may be headed back out of town
[13 May 17:26] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Orly?
[13 May 17:26] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: Are you here tomorrow night? Or leaving before that?
[13 May 17:26] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yeah ;-(
[13 May 17:26] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: Because I'm meeting herlo for dinner tomorrow night at PW Pkwy
[13 May 17:26] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Tomorrow night is bad... If I'm here, I'll have a Boy Scout meeting
[13 May 17:26] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I should see if quigleymd wants to come out or something
[13 May 17:27] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yeah...
[13 May 17:28] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I wish I could make it, but it'd have to be late if came... say after 8:00pm

[13 May 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> sure
[13 May 17:31] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +i just am about to finish my f9 install
[13 May 17:31] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +and want to take an lvm snapshot before i do anything to it
[13 May 17:31] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +but everything online is a little confusing
[13 May 17:31] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +do u have to take the snapshot to another partition?
[13 May 17:32] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> nombyte: urk.
[13 May 17:32] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I haven't ever done snapshots, to tell the truth.
[13 May 17:33] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I believe you have to set up the partitions in advance for that.
[13 May 17:33] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> They reserve space for the snapshots, if I recall correctly
[13 May 17:33] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +thats what i was getting to.
[13 May 17:33] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> You may be able to do that in the system-config-lvm interface.
[13 May 17:33] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +it should then be possible to do a container in a loop device?
[13 May 17:34] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I don't know what you mean by that
[13 May 17:35] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +creating a file with dd of the size u need
[13 May 17:35] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +mount to /dev/loopx
[13 May 17:35] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +and do the snapshot to the file
[13 May 17:45] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: So, I'm sad to say that a reboot made everything work... go figure
[13 May 17:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Hm.
[13 May 17:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Well, that's great then!
[13 May 17:45] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Sure... except for the fact that I had to reboot.
[13 May 17:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> nombyte: Not sure about that.
[13 May 17:45] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Oh well... one less thing to worry about

[13 May 17:50] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Another question if you've got time
[13 May 17:50] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I'm trying to do a network install via Virt-manager
[13 May 17:50] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: What subdirectory of the DVD image do I have to point virt-manager at?
[13 May 17:51] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +DUDE!!! IT PICKED UP MY WIFI!!! WAY TO GO!!!
[13 May 17:53] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> ;-)
[13 May 17:53] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +stickster: i wasn't able to enable the "xtras" repositor on install
[13 May 17:53] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +now i can't find it to add it
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> nombyte: You don't need it once you're installed -- there's "Media" if you installed from DVD, and "fedora" is the whole kit 'n' caboodle.
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: okey dokey
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> uh
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> jsmith: Oh, you have, like, a DVD image mounted loopback and HTTP served?
[13 May 17:54] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +oh nice
[13 May 17:54] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +So I've got CentOS DVD mounted at http://192.168.0.100/CentOS/
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Ah O.
[13 May 17:54] <nombyte!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +the sounds, yet simple, add a nice polish
[13 May 17:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> So that should be it.
[13 May 17:54] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +And I've verified that I can get to it from a web browser on another machine
[13 May 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Because in the CentOS directory you have images/ and repodata/ (among others), right?
[13 May 17:55] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I thought so, but I get "Unable to complete install: 'Could not find an installable distribution at 'http://192.168.0.100/CentOS/''
[13 May 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> That should be it.
[13 May 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Urgh.
[13 May 17:55] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Right... images and repodata
[13 May 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Does it have the proper .discinfo files?
[13 May 17:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> I mean, it was made from a standard ISO?
[13 May 17:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Or is this something you pungi'd up custom?

[13 May 20:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'm up against the "SELinux wants the disk images in /var/lib/xen/images" problem
[13 May 20:59] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I've got the disk image there, and I've run restorecon -R -V /var/lib/xen just to make sure everything is labeled correctly

[13 May 21:18] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> yup
[13 May 21:18] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> You know, I'm sure there's a way to bind mounts or something that would work
[13 May 21:18] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I didn't work hard enough at figuring it out.
[13 May 21:18] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> So I just moved the image to /var/lib/libvirt/images alongside the HDD image.
[13 May 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'm not mounting that ISO... I'm just pointing virt-manager at it

[13 May 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Ah...
[13 May 21:19] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +At this rate, I'll never get anything installed tonight :-(
[13 May 21:19] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I *know* there's a way to solve that easier. I just haven't figured it out yet.
[13 May 21:19] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Well, one way would be to create yourself a special policy module for ISOs in your home directory
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> basically allowing qemu-kvm to read stuff in the user_home_t type.
[13 May 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Ugh... like I'm smart enough to do that
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Let me see, where are the commands for that...
[13 May 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Shoot... I can't restorecon myself out of a wet paper bag
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> It's in the SELinux doc stuff
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Nah, it's actually easy
[13 May 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'll just move the ISO
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> What's silly is there are like five commands you have to run, like a recipe
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I wonder why there isn't a helper for it.
[13 May 21:20] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +If it's something you don't know off the top of your head, it ain't worth me knowing how
[13 May 21:20] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Probably they don't have a helper because this is, you know, *security* :-D
[13 May 21:21] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> No! If it's easy you're Doing It Wrong
[13 May 21:21] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> (the security guy's mantra)
[13 May 21:30] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +And, with that, we're off to the races.
[13 May 21:30] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Thanks for pulling me through... I was sorely tempted to just say "setenforce 0" and follow the path of least resistance
[13 May 21:36] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: awesome
[13 May 21:36] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I had to face this too.
[13 May 21:36] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Ugh... more problems ;-(
[13 May 21:37] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: do tel
[13 May 21:37] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +So I still had a network URL in my kickstart script
[13 May 21:37] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +And so anaconda barfed, and I had to restart the VM
[13 May 21:37] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Is there an easy way to tell it "Hey, restart in install off the local media"?
[13 May 21:37] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +s/in install/an install/

[13 May 21:37] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-76-27-172-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -stickster: if u ever get a free moment I could really use ur help troubleshooting my stupid network problem.  It's getting really frustrating.
[13 May 21:38] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Or should I just go all the way through virt-manager again?
[13 May 21:38] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Hm, I'm not sure.  I thought if it can't find the install source it would drop back to a dialog asking you for one.
[13 May 21:39] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Only if it can't find the kickstart script
[13 May 21:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Oh right. 
[13 May 21:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Yeah, restarting's probably the quickest cure.
[13 May 21:39] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +But if it finds the kickstart script, gets the url, and the files aren't there...
[13 May 21:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: what's up?
[13 May 21:39] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-76-27-172-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -stickster: even on F9, wep / wpa keeps disconnecting after a few mintues...
[13 May 21:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: Hm.
[13 May 21:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I don't know what to tell you

[13 May 22:25] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Hmm, you could reinsert the module with debug=1
[13 May 22:25] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> (or more)
[13 May 22:25] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> It might be debug=255
[13 May 22:25] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> no idea.
[13 May 22:25] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-76-27-172-185.hsd1.va.comcast.net> -so like

[16 May 15:44] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: That's could be a configuration problem --- I have it fine here.
[16 May 15:44] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Did you try a fresh user?
[16 May 15:44] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> -so i added my regular user to any group that had 'pulse' in the name and got the sound back
[16 May 15:44] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Umm
[16 May 15:45] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Shouldn't be required.

[16 May 15:46] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Test with a brand new user account -- if it works there, chances are good it's a specific user configuration problem.

[21 May 14:18] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@65.46.125.186> +k thanks

[21 May 14:21] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@65.46.125.186> +altho, if the package hasn't changed it makes sense
[21 May 14:21] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnp@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> Yes, if there's no new upstream and no reason to recompile
[21 May 14:21] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnp@ip72-219-206-95.dc.dc.cox.net> For Pythonthat would make sense.

[22 May 12:34] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +well - that's like saying you solve obesity by not eating at all :)

[15 Jul 21:44] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +anyone here remember how to set the retension policy of the kernel in yum?
[15 Jul 21:51] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> plarsen: As in, how many?
[15 Jul 21:51] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> plarsen: It's the "installonly_limit" param in /etc/yum.conf
[15 Jul 21:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: right - found that :)  I was looking for something that specified the module or regex for what to keep.
[15 Jul 21:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Still making sure my good old -54 kernel doesn't get overwritten so I can continue to use my wireless ;)
[15 Jul 21:54] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> plarsen: I think you may have to simply up the installonly quite high, and/or get rid of intermediate ones you don't want
[15 Jul 21:55] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> /usr/lib/python-2.5/site-packages/yum/config.py
[15 Jul 21:55] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: yeah - I did that now.
[15 Jul 21:55] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +That way if I miss a kernel update I don't wake up without wireless
[15 Jul 21:55] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Hang on, you may just need a yum-plugin package.
[15 Jul 21:57] <stickster!n=nnnnnpfr@fedora/stickster> plarsen: Check out yum-versionlock.
[15 Jul 21:57] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ohhhhhh
[15 Jul 21:57] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +let me check that one out.
[15 Jul 21:57] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +heh - gotta wait till the update is done ;)
[15 Jul 22:12] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Cool beans!!
[15 Jul 22:12] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Just what I was looking for.

[17 Aug 16:16] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> Stafford, yes -- but not really "stuck"
[17 Aug 16:16] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> Well, OK maybe "stuck." But it's not that bad :-)
[17 Aug 16:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ohhh, sorry - thought it was spotsy.

[17 Aug 16:17] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> They'd be much better off renting it out I guess.
[17 Aug 16:17] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> If they can.
[17 Aug 16:18] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> We bought our house ~11 years ago.
[17 Aug 16:18] <stickster!n=nnnnnnnn@fedora/stickster> So we'll be OK.
[17 Aug 16:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yeah; or simply change his job. I think most of us are "stuck" for another 5 maybe 10 years in our houses :(
[17 Aug 16:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +We bought right at the peak of the market :(
[17 Aug 16:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +We sold too at the peak.
[17 Aug 16:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Should have stayed in rental for 3 years or so ... and then bought
[17 Aug 16:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you may be on financially. But selling now is hard. One house around here even had a fairly new car in the driveway saying "FREE WITH HOUSE"
[17 Aug 16:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Just to get it sold

[12 Sep 19:12] * stickster pings jsmith over here
[12 Sep 19:12] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Hey stickster
[12 Sep 19:12] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> For SFD, I dropped off posters at a bunch of area places, esp. downtown Fburg
[12 Sep 19:12] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Also Borders in C-Park
[12 Sep 19:12] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Coolio
[12 Sep 19:12] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'll burn some CDs next week
[12 Sep 19:13] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I was amazed at (1) how cool some stores were with putting up posters
[12 Sep 19:13] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> (2) How much the Hyperion people were dicks
[12 Sep 19:13] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> (3) How corporate Borders strangles the life out of its store managers
[12 Sep 19:13] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Nevertheless, all of them have posters. Only Borders thus far was OK with giving out CDs and DVDs
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> And they'll probably go on the staff table in the back, not for the public :-(
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I didn't leave them many
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> So that's OK
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> People who were very cool included Griffins, Wounded Bookstore, Virginia Wine
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> sorry, "Virginia Wine Experience"
[12 Sep 19:14] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> And the library worked out fine too
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> We can probably leave whatever media we don't give away there
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I also realized -- now I have something to do with that Novell bag I brought back from UTSC
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> *UTOSC
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I'm going to use it as a giveaway, "name in the hat" thing
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> jsmith: The awesomest news, though, is...
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Michael Zitz did a long interview with me via email this week
[12 Sep 19:15] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> We'll have 20 inches in the paper before SFD happens
[12 Sep 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Awesome
[12 Sep 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +That's great news
[12 Sep 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I'm more than willing to donate my bag too :-)
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Oh, sweet
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I have a poster for you too
[12 Sep 19:17] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Coolio
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> If you can get the bag to my wife before the 20th, I'll be happy to take it off your hands
[12 Sep 19:17] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Will do.
[12 Sep 19:17] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +You on the road next week?
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Would be nice to even out the Fedora and Ubuntu schwag with Novell schwag
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Yeah, I'm in RDU for RHCE
[12 Sep 19:17] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Coming back late Friday night prolly
[12 Sep 19:54] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Gotcha

[14 Sep 14:58] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> As many as you like -- The Open Disc is probably best
[14 Sep 14:59] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yeah got that.

[14 Sep 15:06] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I think the idea is to be *very* general
[14 Sep 15:06] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> plarsen: We'll just talk about free software being available everywhere, Firefox being a good example
[14 Sep 15:06] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> OpenOffice.org being another
[14 Sep 15:07] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> The SFD site http://softwarefreedomday.org/ has good guidelines
[14 Sep 15:07] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +right - so it's more like a presentation than show and tell?
[14 Sep 15:07] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> We just let the public ask questions, and hand out free stuff
[14 Sep 15:07] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> We'll have some giveaways too -- two nice bags from Novell, provided that jsmith-away gets his to me (or my wife) this week
[14 Sep 15:07] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> (I have one already)
[14 Sep 15:09] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Hm.
[14 Sep 15:09] * stickster wonders if anyone's read the OpenDisc FAQ at http://www.theopendisc.com/faq/ about VLC.

[14 Sep 15:12] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I'm not too worried about it, I guess.
[14 Sep 15:12] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> It would just be nice for them to note up front on their site, or provide a US version.
[14 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yeah
[14 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I agree
[14 Sep 15:16] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I just sent a note to the list so people won't get caught by that, hopefully.
[14 Sep 15:16] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Free software shouldn't be illegal software.
[14 Sep 15:16] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Even if it is a completely bogus and stupid law.
[14 Sep 15:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +right - law is still law
[14 Sep 15:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Or at least this isn't really the time and place to battle that law
[14 Sep 15:20] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Exactly
[14 Sep 15:20] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> Nor is SFD, obviously
[14 Sep 15:21] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> The main thing is that people will hopefully get the idea that you can get excellent-quality software, for free, and know where it comes from
[14 Sep 15:23] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Btw. I wish that poster had said Fredericksburg
[14 Sep 15:23] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I might have distributed a few things over here and at work

[15 Sep 17:22] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +I think
[15 Sep 17:23] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yeah... Asterisk, VoIP, and telephony in general
[15 Sep 17:23] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +(how phones work, etc.)
[15 Sep 17:23] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +What kind of audience?
[15 Sep 17:23] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Just rolled out two new classes, and now I'm helping run AstriCon, which is our annual conference
[15 Sep 17:23] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Our Fast Start class is for people with no telephony experience
[15 Sep 17:23] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Our Asterisk Advanced class is for people who know the basics, but want to go into more depth
[15 Sep 17:24] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +So if a company branch like mine wanted to go VOIP - that's not really what they need to look at?
[15 Sep 17:29] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +jsmith: So I guess you're not going to be there Saturday?
[15 Sep 17:29] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Well, the guy running the Asterisk server would want to come to my classes, to know how to manage the server
[15 Sep 17:29] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +plarsen: (Nope... I'll be in Arizona)
[15 Sep 17:30] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +jsmith: right - it's a tech class.What these guys need is an executive (ie. dumbed down) intro to features, abilities etc.
[15 Sep 17:30] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +Man, you must look forward to a home-cooked meal traveling like that. Weren't you just in Utah?
[15 Sep 17:31] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +The Fast Start class is like that... more dumbed down, but still enough tech content that it's not just a marketing spiel.
[15 Sep 17:31] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +plarsen: In the past three weeks, I've been to Alabama, Utah, back to Alabama, and now I'm headed to Arizona.

[15 Sep 17:33] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Nope...
[15 Sep 17:33] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +Yeah - they heard Russia invaded Georgia and they're determined that they won't get any further!

[21 Sep 19:46] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +jsmith: if you're around - I've got a couple of "bot" questions
[21 Sep 19:47] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +plarsen: I'm at your service!
[21 Sep 19:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +:)  The wife is an avid IRC user (as a matter of fact that's how I meet her). It's really been ages since I used IRC actively - I used to be an IRC cop, admin etc.
[21 Sep 19:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +She asked me if I had a bot that she and her friends could use on Undernet in a channel they're running
[21 Sep 19:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +I first thought of infobot but I don't think that's what they need.
[21 Sep 19:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +She has one specific requirement
[21 Sep 19:48] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +It needs to be able to "voice" the women in the channel
[21 Sep 19:49] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Meaning a list of registered nicks that are female should get voice when they join the channel
[21 Sep 19:49] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +do you have ANY clue if there's a ready/set bot out there for that?
[21 Sep 19:49] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Or would tha tbe something infobot could do?
[21 Sep 19:51] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +That isn't something that infobot can do, but chanserv will do it
[21 Sep 19:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +yeah?
[21 Sep 19:52] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Remember, undernet uses X - not chanserv
[21 Sep 19:52] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Ah, should be pretty much the same
[21 Sep 19:52] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +It's the same mechanism to automatically give certain people ops
[21 Sep 19:53] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Well, true - but you have to authenticate against it. This should be an automatic thing I guess. It's really silly - mIRC simply sorts voice nics first ;)
[21 Sep 19:53] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +It's not for access control
[21 Sep 19:54] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Second question - is there a host out there that'll host the infobot for you? Or do you have to run it yourself?
[21 Sep 19:55] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Not sure... a friend of mine hosts infobot
[21 Sep 19:56] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +I could too. The problem is undernet prohibits more than 1- but have implemented a practical 2 - limit of connections per host addy.
[21 Sep 19:57] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +So if I run the bot from home, it'll most likely mean the wife cannot connect
[21 Sep 19:57] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +And that would cause me to REALLY regret the move ;)
[21 Sep 20:04] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I hear you
[21 Sep 21:07] <djs!n=djs@unaffiliated/djs26> +Supybot will do that with a list
[21 Sep 21:07] <djs!n=djs@unaffiliated/djs26> +And I am sure eggdrop will do it as well.

[22 Sep 14:28] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +good afternoon

[22 Sep 15:08] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -hello
[22 Sep 15:08] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +hello
[22 Sep 15:08] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -wow this is awesome
[22 Sep 15:09] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -i have been looking for a place where i can talk with linux folks
[22 Sep 15:09] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +lots of places on here where you can do that
[22 Sep 15:09] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +try ##linux
[22 Sep 15:10] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Pretty much pick your subject and you'll find a channel
[22 Sep 15:10] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -not here in fredericksburg thou
[22 Sep 15:11] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +well no - but what does that matter if you have a question? If someone in singapore can answer, it's just as well as if someone in Frediercksburg did?
[22 Sep 15:12] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -but not the face time with some one who is local andyou could sit down and have a cup of coffee with
[22 Sep 15:12] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -if that makes sense
[22 Sep 15:12] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +well, that's what the monthly meetings are for ;)
[22 Sep 15:13] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -thats what i am getting at :)
[22 Sep 15:13] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -i actually do have a question
[22 Sep 15:13] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +sure!
[22 Sep 15:13] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Go ahead

[22 Sep 15:14] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -fedora 9 and selinux....
[22 Sep 15:14] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -can it happen?
[22 Sep 15:14] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -i know the RH enterprize has the selinux
[22 Sep 15:14] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -but would fedora9 have it as well?
[22 Sep 15:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +fedora has had SELinux since FC6 I think
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +So fedora 9 has it
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +It's enabled by default
[22 Sep 15:15] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -what would be the diff other than the RH is a pay deal and fedora is open sourse?
[22 Sep 15:15] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -source?
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Nothing
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Both are open source
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +what you get with Redhat is "support"
[22 Sep 15:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +you are not paying for redhat
[22 Sep 15:15] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -forgive me if i sound like a noob
[22 Sep 15:16] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -ahh  got it
[22 Sep 15:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +but the services that redhat attaches to it's product
[22 Sep 15:16] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -sorta like M$ and the updates that it give you,,,
[22 Sep 15:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +it's a bit more than that, but yes
[22 Sep 15:16] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -gotcha
[22 Sep 15:16] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -awesome
[22 Sep 15:16] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -good to know..
[22 Sep 15:18] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -if i were to go to a week meeting would the group mind if i came in late..
[22 Sep 15:18] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -as i work in DC...
[22 Sep 15:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +nope
[22 Sep 15:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +it's not like the door is locked ;)
[22 Sep 15:18] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -LOL
[22 Sep 15:18] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -we can hear you but you can't come in...
[22 Sep 15:19] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +I work around the beltway too; for that reason I rarely make it to the Thu. meetings
[22 Sep 15:19] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -and i work on daturdays
[22 Sep 15:19] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -saturdays
[22 Sep 15:19] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -so that kills that
[22 Sep 15:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +which is why there's two meetings
[22 Sep 15:20] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -yes
[22 Sep 15:20] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -understood
[22 Sep 15:20] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -;)
[22 Sep 15:20] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +we can't all have time at the same time
[22 Sep 15:20] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -exactly
[22 Sep 15:24] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -another question
[22 Sep 15:25] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -is there a magazine that you recommend for Lunix?
[22 Sep 15:25] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -Linux
[22 Sep 15:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +I have a few ... sometimes they're better than others.
[22 Sep 15:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +I find this forum to be a ton better
[22 Sep 15:45] <plarsen!n=plarsen@75-139-118-193.dhcp.mant.nc.charter.com> +Linux Pro is faily new but looks ok

[23 Sep 09:08] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Hey... any idea why a recent Fedora update would have hosed my keyboard under X?
[23 Sep 09:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Uh, none at all
[23 Sep 09:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> First I've heard of it.
[23 Sep 09:08] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I was able to run system-config-display --reconfig and get a working config again, but now I have no trackpad :-(
[23 Sep 09:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> jsmith: BTW, while you're here -- just confirming -- you have that bag I can give away, yes?

[23 Sep 09:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> jsmith: The trackpad thing is probably just the synaptics driver needed, right?
[23 Sep 09:09] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +(we renamed it for the conference)
[23 Sep 09:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Not a problem re: Phoenix
[23 Sep 09:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> jsmith: When will you be back?
[23 Sep 09:09] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Most likely...but the other config has that, and it's very likely causing the keyboard problems
[23 Sep 09:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Aha
[23 Sep 09:09] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'll be back on the 29th
[23 Sep 09:10] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> OK.
[23 Sep 09:10] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I'll let the winners know one will be available on Saturday morning, the other the meeting afterward (2-Oct I think)
[23 Sep 09:12] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I'm clueless about the trackpad/keyboard thing on the whole, sorry :-(
[23 Sep 09:13] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +No worries

[26 Sep 10:08] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: Hm, are you sure you have the various telepathy-* packages installed?
[26 Sep 10:09] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +Nope, I'm not sure ><.
[26 Sep 10:09] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: I see a bunch of plugins there.
[26 Sep 10:09] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +I will check tho.
[26 Sep 10:09] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> That plugin architecture is one of the really cool design choices in telepathy
[26 Sep 10:09] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +I never saw a response, will the empathy voice be compatible with skype clients?

[26 Sep 10:10] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: I think COD replied no, but I can say the same here -- I don't see how it would be possible without Skype opening their source.

[26 Sep 10:10] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> In other words, Skype is closed, proprietary software.

[26 Sep 10:11] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: I invite you to try -- many people already have. Skype goes to *great* lengths to obfuscate their code.

[06 Oct 10:53] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> *conf
[06 Oct 10:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: ATI is a separate issue -- but it's an ATI issue, not a Fedora one
[06 Oct 10:54] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +there is not system-config-display
[06 Oct 10:54] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: On the beta live disc, there's not?
[06 Oct 10:54] * stickster not running one here
[06 Oct 10:54] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +I installed from the beta dvd
[06 Oct 10:55] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +If I go under System -> Look and Feel -> Hardware -> Resolution
[06 Oct 10:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> You can 'yum install system-config-display' if needed

[06 Oct 10:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Under discussion this very morning in #fedora-qa apparently
[06 Oct 10:56] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +lol go me ^^
[06 Oct 10:57] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +in the kernel names
[06 Oct 10:57] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +what does rc8 and git 4 mean?
[06 Oct 12:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: rc == release candidate
[06 Oct 12:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> git is the SCM used for the kernel
[06 Oct 12:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> meaning it's probably based on a copy of the git master branch
[06 Oct 12:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> If there was a further patch to fix something but the source is the same, it would change to git5, iirc
[06 Oct 12:42] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +ah thanks
[06 Oct 13:02] * stickster waves at jsmith

[06 Oct 13:02] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Pretty well

[06 Oct 13:03] * jsmith is battling car problems over lunch
[06 Oct 13:03] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> oh, ouch
[06 Oct 13:04] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Something pernicious?
[06 Oct 13:07] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Let's just say it's either the crankshaft or camshaft position sensors, or something a whole lot worse :-/
[06 Oct 13:07] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Ugh
[06 Oct 13:07] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +And so far, I haven't even found where said sensors are located, and I'm looking at the dealership's repair manual
[06 Oct 13:08] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +So I'm in way over my head to begin with
[06 Oct 13:19] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: yikes.
[06 Oct 13:19] * stickster gets back from afk, sorry
[06 Oct 13:20] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: No worries...
[06 Oct 16:34] <GGD_afk!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> -greetings all
[06 Oct 16:35] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +stickster?
[06 Oct 16:35] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> GGD: what's up?
[06 Oct 16:35] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i have a fedora question for you
[06 Oct 16:36] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Shoot
[06 Oct 16:39] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +you here?
[06 Oct 16:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> yup
[06 Oct 16:40] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i installed fedora 9 from CD and it installed ok
[06 Oct 16:40] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +but when i try to go to the internet or do a yum to install a package it will not resolve the address etc
[06 Oct 16:40] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +although i can putty into itt
[06 Oct 16:40] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and i know the ip and SN and GW and DNS are all correct
[06 Oct 16:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> How does your /etc/resolv.conf file look?
[06 Oct 16:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> And how are you connected to the internet?
[06 Oct 16:41] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i dont' know as i am at home not at work
[06 Oct 16:41] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +through the office network
[06 Oct 16:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Oh, is the box at work?
[06 Oct 16:41] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +yes
[06 Oct 16:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> OK.
[06 Oct 16:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Is the box connected to an office network?
[06 Oct 16:41] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +yes
[06 Oct 16:41] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and all the ip info is correct
[06 Oct 16:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Do you control that network's DNS servers, or do you know how they're configured?
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +as i can putty into it from a different machine
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +no i don't
[06 Oct 16:42] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Right, so it's getting an address from DNS.
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +would there be a difference?
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +yes
[06 Oct 16:42] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> sorry
[06 Oct 16:42] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> My brain is fried today.
[06 Oct 16:42] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Right, so it's getting an address from *DHCP*.
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +its cool man i have those days too
[06 Oct 16:42] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +no its a static ip
[06 Oct 16:42] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Oh.
[06 Oct 16:43] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Did you get that static IP from whoever's running that network?
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +yes
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and it work
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +works
[06 Oct 16:43] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Did they give you DNS server addresses too?
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +as i had RHEL 4.0 on the same box before i put on fedora
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and it worked
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +not a prob
[06 Oct 16:43] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +yes
[06 Oct 16:44] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> OK. You may want to make sure that NetworkManager is *not* running on that system.
[06 Oct 16:44] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> as root:   /sbin/service NetworkManager stop
[06 Oct 16:44] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and my M$ box hits it just fine outside
[06 Oct 16:44] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +network manager?
[06 Oct 16:44] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +ok
[06 Oct 16:44] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster>     and:  /sbin/chkconfig NetworkManager off
[06 Oct 16:44] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Then from the menu, check System > Administration > Network
[06 Oct 16:44] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +oh ok
[06 Oct 16:44] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i will do  that
[06 Oct 16:44] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> And make sure the interface is configured as you expect
[06 Oct 16:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Once you do that, you may need to bring the network service down and back up
[06 Oct 16:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> i.e.   /sbin/service network restart
[06 Oct 16:45] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +also is fedora "locked up" be default?
[06 Oct 16:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> ?
[06 Oct 16:45] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> By default there's a firewall enabled that doesn't have any open ports other than SSH, if I recall correctly.
[06 Oct 16:46] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Plus SELinux should be in Enforcing mode, which also helps.
[06 Oct 16:46] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i had a buddy in another part of the office scan the box and couldn't find anything openn to hit upon
[06 Oct 16:46] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> The default configuration should be fairly secure for most people, but YMMV
[06 Oct 16:46] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +ymmv?
[06 Oct 16:47] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Your Mileage May Vary
[06 Oct 16:47] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +ok?/ forgive me i don't understand that
[06 Oct 16:47] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> np
[06 Oct 16:47] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Oops
[06 Oct 16:47] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> No problem
[06 Oct 16:47] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +no i got that
[06 Oct 16:47] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +:)
[06 Oct 16:47] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> cool :-)
[06 Oct 16:47] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +np i got
[06 Oct 16:48] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +i am learning all this stuff :)
[06 Oct 16:48] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +its been a while since i hit a linux/unix box
[06 Oct 16:49] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and  i would love to get into it more
[06 Oct 16:49] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +as i think this is the way to go
[06 Oct 16:49] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and i am glad that Fred has a group like this
[06 Oct 16:49] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I usually use Empathy for IM, along with telepathy-* stuff for supporting different connections like GTalk, AIM, etc.
[06 Oct 16:50] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +the reason that i as is that i am on yahoo at work  and wanted to hit you up there if i run into issues
[06 Oct 16:50] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +if you don't mind
[06 Oct 16:50] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> I really don't have time to do a lot of technical support 1-on-1, hope you understand
[06 Oct 16:50] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +sure
[06 Oct 16:50] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> But we have the #fedora IRC channel, which could help
[06 Oct 16:50] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> There's also FedoraForum.org if you have time to do forum posts and wait for an answer that way
[06 Oct 16:51] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +and i would galdly jump onto that but IRC isn't happy looked good upon
[06 Oct 16:51] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Just from a network perspective?
[06 Oct 16:51] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +security
[06 Oct 16:51] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> There are some free web gateways out there you can use if you're worried about non-port-80 traffic.
[06 Oct 16:52] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +oh yea?
[06 Oct 16:52] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> GGD: http://www.mibbit.com/
[06 Oct 16:52] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> (for instance)
[06 Oct 16:52] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +awesome

[06 Oct 17:01] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Sorry, was working
[06 Oct 17:01] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Yup
[06 Oct 17:01] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Will do
[06 Oct 17:01] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +sorry i didn't know if you were gon or not
[06 Oct 17:01] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +gne
[06 Oct 17:01] <GGD!n=GGD@ip72-205-5-167.dc.dc.cox.net> +arrgh
[06 Oct 17:28] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Got a minute?
[06 Oct 17:28] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Sure
[06 Oct 17:28] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Just installed F10Beta, and having an epic failure... wondered if you had time to debug before I wipe and try again
[06 Oct 17:28] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> whoa-oh
[06 Oct 17:28] * stickster needs to install and taste the pain
[06 Oct 17:28] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Installation went fine, except I think NetworkManager seg-faulted at the very end of the install (when I told it to reboot)
[06 Oct 17:29] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: On boot-up, I get the fugly plymouth screen (white bar chasing light blue chasing dark blue)
[06 Oct 17:29] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I found out what the nice one requires
[06 Oct 17:29] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: You need to add "vga=0x317" or a like mode to your GRUB
[06 Oct 17:29] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +It gets to the point where the white bar eats the blue bars and "Fedora 9.1.91" turns white, and then it hangs
[06 Oct 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Um, ugh.
[06 Oct 17:30] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I don't get any kind of GRUB screen at all... still not sure why
[06 Oct 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Ah, it's a quick catch -- in the release notes
[06 Oct 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> You have to hit space bar or something pretty darn fast
[06 Oct 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Basically the timeout is turned off in GRUB now
[06 Oct 17:30] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +If I hit the right arrow key, I get a blank screen with a blinking cursor is all
[06 Oct 17:30] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> (by default)
[06 Oct 17:30] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Gotcha
[06 Oct 17:31] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: And I think removing "rhgb" from the boot line works as it used to, to turn plymouth off if you need to see the display for debugging.
[06 Oct 17:32] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +OK... now I've got the fancy plymouth, but it still hangs
[06 Oct 17:32] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Argh.
[06 Oct 17:32] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Yeah, try without the "rhgb" and see what that reveals
[06 Oct 17:32] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +(Well, the little animation continues, until I press the right arrow, at which time it hangs)
[06 Oct 17:33] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Eww.
[06 Oct 17:34] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Booted without Plymouth (rhgb) and it prompts me for my LUKS password
[06 Oct 17:34] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I type it, and it says "Command failed: Can not access device"
[06 Oct 17:35] * stickster responds with another useless groan
[06 Oct 17:35] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +It seems the disk was sdf when it was installed, but now it's showing up as sda
[06 Oct 17:35] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> O rly?
[06 Oct 17:35] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Somebody hard-code the device name in there?
[06 Oct 17:35] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> But the system should be using LABEL for everything
[06 Oct 17:35] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +If so, that's totally made out of fail
[06 Oct 17:35] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Exactly
[06 Oct 17:36] * stickster getting a fresh Rawhide to try it out
[06 Oct 17:36] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> You're using the install set, and not the Live?
[06 Oct 17:36] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Correct
[06 Oct 17:36] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Sounds like it's time to re-install without LUKS, right?
[06 Oct 17:37] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +
[06 Oct 17:37] * jsmith only told it to do encryption just to test it out
[06 Oct 17:37] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Hm, I suppose it's worth trying without.
[06 Oct 17:37] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> That's... of concern though.
[06 Oct 17:38] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Yeah... should I file a bug?
[06 Oct 17:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I think the only good answer I can give you is, install from Rawhide instead and see if that works better
[06 Oct 17:39] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Is there someone I should work with to debug this before I wipe it?
[06 Oct 17:39] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +
[06 Oct 17:39] * jsmith has no access to rawhide, due to his slow internet access
[06 Oct 17:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Oh yeah
[06 Oct 17:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Hm.
[06 Oct 17:39] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> And you can't really update effectively either.
[06 Oct 17:40] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Updates are fairly painless... just takes an overnight or two of downloading
[06 Oct 17:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> KVM?
[06 Oct 17:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Blah
[06 Oct 17:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Never mind.
[06 Oct 17:40] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: You could check in #fedora-qa to see if it's a known issue
[06 Oct 17:41] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: Other than that... You're in a tight sitch because you can't effectively try new packages with a slow connection :-(
[06 Oct 17:43] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Not unless you feel like rolling me a new DVD
[06 Oct 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: I can do that
[06 Oct 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> jsmith: You can always come work over here :-D
[06 Oct 17:55] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> We have more furniture in the basement now
[06 Oct 17:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> A nice futon sofa and the papasan chair has been "refurbished" with a brand new cushion
[06 Oct 17:56] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Plus, there's Wii now, for when you get bored
[06 Oct 17:56] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: Tempt me not!
[06 Oct 17:56] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: I was back and forth past your subdivision all weekend, fwiw
[06 Oct 17:56] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +stickster: And that little pizza and subs place around the corner... awesome!
[06 Oct 17:57] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> You should have come by yesterday and you could have jammed with my kids on Rock Band
[06 Oct 17:57] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> My shoulders hurt a bit -- last night I drummed my way through 4 stages of the tour on "Medium"
[06 Oct 17:58] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +Oh man... I was only there from about noon 'til about 6:30 :-p
[06 Oct 17:59] * stickster getting ready to head to dinner
[06 Oct 18:02] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> Ugh, I think I need to get up at like 5am tomorrow to make it to DC for the RHGUDC show.
[06 Oct 18:02] <stickster!n=nnnpfrie@fedora/stickster> :-P
[06 Oct 18:02] * stickster heats up his CPU with squashfs.

[09 Oct 09:41] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I figured out what was causing LUKs to break on the F10 beta

[09 Oct 09:54] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I saw it was still in a NEW state, and it's been my experience that if they stay that way, then tend to get ignored :-(

[09 Oct 10:12] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +For some reason, I had it in my head that after about 10:00am it was "mid day"... shows how little I know of Danish culture, I guess...

[10 Oct 17:57] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Beta is out
[10 Oct 17:58] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: yea I installed it in a vm.  Couldn't get tools installed and it locked up the laptop ><
[10 Oct 17:58] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> nmcbride: Let me guess, you're using a proprietary VM system
[10 Oct 17:59] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: ...virtualbox... ><
[10 Oct 17:59] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Next door then ;-)
[10 Oct 17:59] * stickster suggests KVM.
[10 Oct 17:59] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I just deleted it for the time being.
[10 Oct 17:59] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Really?
[10 Oct 17:59] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Is that up to par now?
[10 Oct 17:59] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Has been for some time.
[10 Oct 17:59] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> And it's the only VM that doesn't make you jump through weird kernel hoops because it's built into the Linux kernel.
[10 Oct 18:00] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But it suggestions not doing windows with it.
[10 Oct 18:00] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Nope, I have done Windows with it with no problems
[10 Oct 18:00] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I might have to give it another shot then.
[10 Oct 18:00] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> In my case it was Windows XP -- I didn't have any Vista with which to try it.
[10 Oct 18:00] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +does it support the 3 common network types?
[10 Oct 18:00] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +nat, bridge, and host only?
[10 Oct 18:00] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> Try #kvm for help with it
[10 Oct 18:01] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I will, I think I'll wait till 10 tho.

[10 Oct 18:06] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> video=vesafb  might do it
[10 Oct 18:06] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +used elinks and installed livna
[10 Oct 18:06] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +now trying with the drivers
[10 Oct 18:07] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> I think rpmfusion is the new repo where that non-free stuff is built
[10 Oct 18:07] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> livna has merged with some others into rpmfusion finally
[10 Oct 18:07] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +oh
[10 Oct 18:10] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +we got video ><

[10 Oct 18:15] <stickster!n=nnnnpfri@fedora/stickster> depending on your default runlevel
[10 Oct 18:16] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@c-24-125-17-152.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ah, I didn't know but aparently since I did everything by hand it never came up so I was just wandering if there was a way.

[17 Oct 11:44] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +how can I stop this
[17 Oct 11:44] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +is this a syslog setting?
[17 Oct 11:45] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Right
[17 Oct 11:45] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> AFAIK you can't redirect to a file using iptables config itself
[17 Oct 11:46] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +ok, ya I just want to stop the from being displayed on stdout so I can fix the machine.
[17 Oct 11:47] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> /etc/rsyslog.conf, I think all kernel messages go to /dev/console.
[17 Oct 11:47] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +that line is commented out
[17 Oct 11:48] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Right, but I believe it's the default too.
[17 Oct 11:48] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +oh
[17 Oct 11:48] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +I can't even look at the dumb file because of all the messages coming onto the screen
[17 Oct 11:49] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> You could just do:
[17 Oct 11:49] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> oh
[17 Oct 11:50] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> is this RHEL or Fedora?
[17 Oct 11:50] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +RHEL
[17 Oct 11:50] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> rsyslog or syslog?
[17 Oct 11:50] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Well, still should be able to handle this syntax:
[17 Oct 11:50] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> echo 'kern.*  /var/log/kernel-log.txt' >> /etc/rsyslog.conf 
[17 Oct 11:50] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +its syslog
[17 Oct 11:51] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Yeah, still works.
[17 Oct 11:51] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +there is no rsyslog.conf
[17 Oct 11:51] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Right, use syslog.conf
[17 Oct 11:52] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +hmm says its a read-only file system
[17 Oct 11:53] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> That's a separate problem then.
[17 Oct 11:53] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Could be a security feature the admin set up.
[17 Oct 11:53] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Not a bad idea for systems that are to be left alone.

[19 Oct 19:13] * jsmith waves to plarsen 
[19 Oct 19:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hey there
[19 Oct 19:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +man, we're making a habbit of this!
[19 Oct 19:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +jsmith: Well, I was just wondering if the stickster would have some input on the move wikipedia made and has made a big official bru-haha out of.
[19 Oct 19:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Basically blaming it on yum. Given what stickster has talked about lately, I sense a relation there.
[19 Oct 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +No clue, honestly
[19 Oct 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +But I know one of the main Wikipedia sysadmins
[19 Oct 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I'll ping him next time I see him online
[19 Oct 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +I think it was more about "Fedora churns too quickly for a server environment" than anything to do with yum
[19 Oct 19:16] <jsmith!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +but that's just me reading between the lines
[19 Oct 19:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +jsmith: Given their "FAQ" I get the distinct impression it's mostly because of yum
[19 Oct 19:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But yes, they did mention the turnaround.
[19 Oct 19:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +The reason they didn't go fully Debian - dispite having a house full of Debian syadmins, was the slowness of stable releases. At the same time, they complain that Fedora is changing too fast ;)
[19 Oct 19:19] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-189-28.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I read someone talk about using FC3 at Wikipedia ... I wouldn't exactly say that looks like they've had a lot of upgrade problems lately ;)

[20 Oct 10:36] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +stickster: basically I wanted to sync my phone with my thunderbird/evolution and came to realize how many issues there are with that.
[20 Oct 10:36] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +atleast over usb
[20 Oct 10:36] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> No idea
[20 Oct 10:36] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +so I was thinking I could easily make a python app to do it and make a ce app for the phone and do it over wife

[20 Oct 10:37] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +wanted ur opinion first
[20 Oct 10:38] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> I know there's a libopensync out there
[20 Oct 10:38] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> (maybe that name is wrong)
[20 Oct 10:38] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> But something that's open ended for conduits to/from Evo

[20 Oct 10:38] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +thats the part I wanted ur opinion on
[20 Oct 10:39] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +why not just use the wifi and sync to a program on the laptop or you could even make it web based
[20 Oct 10:39] <nmcbride!n=nmcbride@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +sync ur email contacts to the web
[20 Oct 10:42] <jsmith-teaching!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +nmcbride: Use multisync/opensync
[20 Oct 10:42] <jsmith-teaching!n=njsmith@72.21.36.138> +It'll work with Windows CE/Mobile and many of the other phones out there that support SyncML

[09 Dec 16:03] <jsmith!n=jsmith@asterisk/training-and-documentation-guru/jsmith> +Apparently somebody complained "Help, somebody used my Asterisk box to do bad things", and a poorly-worded press release went out.
[09 Dec 16:04] <jsmith!n=jsmith@asterisk/training-and-documentation-guru/jsmith> +What really happened was that the poor victim in this case had a terribly misconfigured system, and the vulnerability had been patched about 9 months ago.
[09 Dec 16:04] <jsmith!n=jsmith@asterisk/training-and-documentation-guru/jsmith> +On top of that, nobody tried to contact Digium before making the press release, and when we tried to call them back to get more details, nobody would return our calls

[11 Jan 22:05] <IrishW0lf!n=william@113.sub-75-196-195.myvzw.com> -exactly, the flakeyness started after i did the updates
[11 Jan 22:06] <IrishW0lf!n=william@113.sub-75-196-195.myvzw.com> -and grub shows two separate kernel versions
[11 Jan 22:07] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +In a lot of cases you don't need the kernel upgrades. The changes are in the "edges" that you don't use - support for new drivers, fixing of driver issues etc.
[11 Jan 22:07] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so you can try with the old kernel
[11 Jan 22:08] <IrishW0lf!n=william@113.sub-75-196-195.myvzw.com> -did that, didn't seem to help, but i think i have to change the vid driver somehow.  it is running an ATI internal card

[30 Jan 09:33] <stickster!n=npfrield@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> KDE 4.2 was just released, and it looks like we may in fact be moving to KDE 4.2 on Fedora 10, as well as having it in the Fedora 11 Alpha.

[30 Jan 09:34] <stickster!n=npfrield@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The old libraries in KDE 3 are not maintained, meaning that they're not getting developer attention, security fixes, etc.

[09 Feb 11:24] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> IrishW0lf: Typically, I'll install 'system-config-display' and then run it to build a default /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  (Modern Xorg doesn't use a config file in most cases, unless you provide one.)
[09 Feb 11:25] <stickster!n=nnpfriel@fedora/stickster> When you run s-c-d, it will give you widescreen options inside the "Generic LCD monitor" setting
[09 Feb 11:26] <IrishW0lf!n=william@115.sub-75-197-24.myvzw.com> +is that through yum to install the system-config-display?

[16 Feb 09:41] <jsmith!n=nnnjsmit@asterisk/training-and-documentation-guru/jsmith> +Day off?

[16 Feb 11:01] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Ok - I need some resources on how to make USBs bootable - or rather convert an ISO image to a bootable USB image. Even better, if anyone know how to get qemu to boot on the USB to test the boot image
[16 Feb 11:01] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Anyone have any ideas??  jsmith/stickster/quiqleymd ??
[16 Feb 11:02] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: http://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator
[16 Feb 11:03] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: If you're using qemu, you could boot from the ISO directly, but you can also use 'livecd-iso-to-disk' in the 'livecd-tools' package to write an ISO to a USB disk
[16 Feb 11:03] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> I believe you could write that image out to a different block device
[16 Feb 11:04] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> So for instance, a partitioned loop device, or something like that.
[16 Feb 11:05] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: I'm not looking for a live image. I'm trying with a full install image (the fedora DVD image) - and when I tried the liveusb-creator it refused because it wasn't a LIVE ISO
[16 Feb 11:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: Right, that won't work.
[16 Feb 11:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The livecd-tools are built to work from a Live image.
[16 Feb 11:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> But... 
[16 Feb 11:06] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: I have a TUX box which only have USB as external devices. I want to have recovery boot/install images on a USB key with the server.
[16 Feb 11:07] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: Why not make your own custom Live bootable image then?
[16 Feb 11:08] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well - good idea. If I knew the attributes of a live cd vs. a normal cd, I think I could. But beyond being able to use them, I'm not sure how they're constructed so they work. In other words, I don't know how to create one myself.
[16 Feb 11:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: Ah, that part's easy enough
[16 Feb 11:08] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: You want the 'livecd-creator' tool, also in the 'livecd-tools' package
[16 Feb 11:08] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Btw; that reminds me - for FOSE I'm looking for cheap 1GB usb keys - anyknow know where I can buy them in bulk for no more than $2 a piece?
[16 Feb 11:09] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: 'livecd-creator' takes a kickstart file as an input and builds a Live image from it
[16 Feb 11:09] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ok - let me check ;)
[16 Feb 11:09] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Does the live image have a recovery image too?
[16 Feb 11:10] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: Well, in a sense, the Live image *is* your recovery image
[16 Feb 11:10] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> You can use it to transfer a copy of itself to the hard disk
[16 Feb 11:11] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: hmmm; so I need to think about what file system tools to include ?
[16 Feb 11:11] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The Live image based installation doesn't offer the opportunity for package selection
[16 Feb 11:11] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> So you just build those into your kickstart file, and build the image with those packages included.
[16 Feb 11:12] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> If you need something that's not packaged, you can include that using the %post and it will be present on the Live image and anything to which you install from the Live image.
[16 Feb 11:13] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +That shouldn't be necessary. This is for emergency boot only. Although I may want to have it boot up with a fixed IP
[16 Feb 11:13] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: I haven't found any 1 GB USB keys under $5
[16 Feb 11:13] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Which doesn't mean they don't exist... I don't look that often
[16 Feb 11:13] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: I found 2GB at Microcenter for $5 yesterday - but they only had 4
[16 Feb 11:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I found some online - but they all have "stock" problems
[16 Feb 11:14] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: The network configuration stuff shouldn't be an issue either.  You can set the kickstart file to write the appropriate configs in %post.
[16 Feb 11:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I was thinking to maybe use a promotional site and have "Fedora" or something printed on them
[16 Feb 11:14] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: Bzzzt, trademark infringement
[16 Feb 11:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +lol
[16 Feb 11:14] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +It would be a fedora live image that would be on the USB key
[16 Feb 11:14] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> But, providing Live keys is fine :-)
[16 Feb 11:15] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Maybe "Linux Rocks" then :D
[16 Feb 11:15] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Ah, if you're providing the Fedora Live images from the site on USB, that's no problem with trademarks then
[16 Feb 11:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Nope - I didn't think so. I wanted to be able to hand out some USB live images; they're much handier (and faster) than the CD version
[16 Feb 11:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But I'm not paying $10 per key
[16 Feb 11:16] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> They simply have to be the stock version of the distro
[16 Feb 11:16] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Yeah, $10 is simply exorbitant
[16 Feb 11:16] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I downloaded the images a few months back (via torrent). It doesn't talk about secondary version
[16 Feb 11:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Should I redo that?
[16 Feb 11:17] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> secondary version?
[16 Feb 11:17] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +"stock version" - I thought a new/updated package of F10 had been made a little while ago? I just can't see which build the live image is that I downloaded
[16 Feb 11:18] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The one that comes off get.fedoraproject.org is the one you wan

[16 Feb 11:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that's what I got- but it's a few months old
[16 Feb 11:18] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But it is F10
[16 Feb 11:19] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Right, end of November 2008 hopefully, right?

[16 Feb 11:19] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> If I were you, I'd look at 2 GB USB keys:
[16 Feb 11:19] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134817
[16 Feb 11:19] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> $5.49
[16 Feb 11:20] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> I use those, from Kingston, to provide Live images for the press to pimp our releases when they come out. Haven't had problems with them -- USB 2.0, acceptable performance
[16 Feb 11:20] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> 2 GB also gives you the ability to install a persistent overlay, and a reasonable /home
[16 Feb 11:21] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> s@reasonable /home@reasonable, persistent /home@
[16 Feb 11:21] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I thought I would have about 300-400MB for an overlay on a 1GB key?
[16 Feb 11:21] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +But if they're available I may have to go with those - just get fewer of them.
[16 Feb 11:22] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Well, the live image is about 700 MB, so with a "1 GB" key you have about 200 MB left after the other LiveOS stuff
[16 Feb 11:22] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The price tends to be almost no difference from 1 GB <-> 2 GB
[16 Feb 11:22] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> So I tend to buy 2 GB as a minimum, and use ~768 MB overlay and 384 MB /home
[16 Feb 11:23] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> But there's some flexibility there
[16 Feb 11:23] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Image is dated at my download time - dec 28th
[16 Feb 11:23] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but I'm pretty sure it's the november one
[16 Feb 11:23] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Yeah, that link above has the SHA-1's.
[16 Feb 11:24] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sha match
[16 Feb 11:24] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> awesome
[16 Feb 11:25] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmm - excuse my ignorance. But I thought "overlay" = /home ?
[16 Feb 11:25] <jsmith!n=nnnjsmit@asterisk/training-and-documentation-guru/jsmith> +I *used* to think that too...
[16 Feb 11:25] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> The overlay is basically the difference between / on the original image, and its current state
[16 Feb 11:26] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Whereas /home is a separate partition you can use, which can also survive a new LiveOS install
[16 Feb 11:26] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> So when you turn that key into a F11 Live image later, you can keep your /home (which, by the way, is encrypted by default unless you opt for it not to be at creation time)
[16 Feb 11:27] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hmmm - iso-to-livecd that I've run doesn't ask for a /home ?
[16 Feb 11:28] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +How do you specify that?
[16 Feb 11:28] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ehhh liveusb
[16 Feb 11:28] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: livecd-creator turns a KS file into an ISO.
[16 Feb 11:28] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> livecd-iso-to-disk is where you transfer that ISO to USB and provide options for /home, overlay, etc.
[16 Feb 11:29] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: I have liveusb-creator ... that's not it?
[16 Feb 11:29] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Becuase that only asks for persistent storage
[16 Feb 11:29] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and the ISO
[16 Feb 11:29] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> liveusb-creator is a GUI that may not be quite up to date with the livecd-iso-to-disk binary
[16 Feb 11:29] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> I'll have to get on Luke about that :-)
[16 Feb 11:30] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +hehe
[16 Feb 11:30] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> Of course it *is* Python, maybe I can fix it :-)
[16 Feb 11:31] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ok - last time I did kickstart was 1.5 years ago
[16 Feb 11:31] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I thought there was a way you could record the CURRENT setup?
[16 Feb 11:31] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> plarsen: I think there's a system-config-kickstart that might help
[16 Feb 11:31] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> When you did your initial installation, the result was recorded in /root/anaconda.ks I believe
[16 Feb 11:31] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Ok - I actualy downloaded that - but didn't look at it.
[16 Feb 11:32] <stickster!n=pfrields@ip72-205-14-2.dc.dc.cox.net> But you may have changed quite a bit since the initial installation, of course

[16 Feb 11:33] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I did get a USB to boot up, but anaconda would not read the RPMS from the USB stick. It only gave me CDROM and harddrive

[16 Feb 11:37] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +So when I create the ks - should I keep things at "cdrom" and hope that liveiso-to-disk will change things?
[16 Feb 14:03] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> plarsen: The installation method is the method that will be used to create the Live ISO image. So use something that would work in the situation of a real installation rigth now
[16 Feb 14:03] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> *right
[16 Feb 14:03] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> You may want to consult http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda for more kickstart information
[16 Feb 14:03] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Uhmmm - thanks. I created an image with just the base package. Kernel panics on boot though
[16 Feb 14:04] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> I don't see the "mirrorlist" or "mirror" methods listed there.

[16 Feb 14:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> plarsen: You might want to look at the contents of http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spin-kickstarts.git (F10 branch)
[16 Feb 14:05] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> There are some KS files there, the same ones we use for the distro, and for some other specialized spins
[16 Feb 14:06] <stickster!n=pfrields@fedora/stickster> Might give you some hints.
[16 Feb 14:36] <plarsen!n=plarsen@c-67-166-188-224.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +uhmm - well, the original Centos image fails/panics too ... me thinks this is a qemu problem

[17 Feb 14:31] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +Box two has two nics - and the two MACs shown are the MACs of that box

[17 Feb 14:35] <plarsen!n=plarsen@ip65-46-125-186.z125-46-65.customer.algx.net> +But there's somekind of selection process (that's what I call routing) on which interface to use to reply with?
